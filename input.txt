Verse One:
Young black male
I try to effect by kicking the facts
and stacking much mail
I'm packing a gat cuz guys wanna jack
and fuck goin to jail
Cuz I ain't equipped to stop how I look
I don't sell ya-yo
They teachin a brother like I was in books
Follow me into a flow
I'm sure you know, which way to go
I'm hittin em out of the dopes
So slip on the slope, let's skip on the flow
I'm fuckin the sluts and hoes
The bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
The gimminy jimminy grows
Then whaddya know, it's off with some clothes
Rowd when the crowd says hoe
That let's me know, they know I can flow
Love when they come to my shows
I get up and go, with skins before
When I'm collecting my dough
I never respect, the one that I back
The quicker the nigga can rap
The bigger the check, now watch how they sweat
What kind of style is that?
The style of a mack, and ready to jack
I rendered up piles of black
The wacker the pack, the fatter the smack
I hate it when real nigga bust
They hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust
I had enough of the fuss
I bust what I bust, and cuss when I must
They gave me a charge for sales
For selling the tales... of young black males
Yes nigga, N-I-G-G-A niggaz
Ay nigga you can't handle that shit!
Pass that man!
Hit that shit, that's the shit!
It smell like skunk, skunk smell like that nigga momma
We ain't nuttin but some low down dirty niggaz
Keep it real nigga, fuck you nigga!
You ain't givin me near a dime on this real motherfucker
Fuck St. Ide's it's an Old E thing baby
Strictly some of that Hennesee
Can I drink with you fellas?  Can I get it on it?
Fuck you Capo.  You ain't in baby.
I tell you what!  You guys are not gonna be talking
all that shit, when I come back, OK?
We gonna say who the big mouth, when I come back
YOUNG BLACK MALE!







You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do to me
Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
Niggas commin' out worse off than when they went in
Over tha years I done alot of growin' up
Getten drunk thrown' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho
And when I gettem
I'll hittem with tha bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
They got me trapped....
Chorus
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
Can barely walk tha city streets
Without a cop harrassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
Bang bang, down another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
Who do you blame?
It's a shame because tha mans slain
He got caught in tha chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day i'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
(Tupac Talking)
They cuttin off welfare
Think they crime is risin' now
You got whites killin blacks
Cops killin blacks
And blacks killin blacks
Shit just gonna get worse
They just gonna become souljas
Straight souljas
Chorus
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
Crack done took apart of our family tree
my momma's on tha shit, my dadies splitten, mom's steady blaming me
is it my fault, just cause i'm a young black male
cop sweat me as if my destiny is makin' crack sells
only 15 and got problems
cops on my tail, so I bail till I dodge 'em
they finally pull me over and I laugh
remember Rodney King and I blast on his punk ass
now I gotta murder case
you speak a' Heaven punk, I never heard of tha place
what is it ta come up fast, got a Uz and a black mask
drop tha fuckin task, now who's tha jack ass
keep my shit cocked, cause tha cops got a glock too
what tha fuck would you do
drop them or let 'em drop you
I chose droppin' tha cop
I got me a glock, and a glock for tha niggas on my block
4 of'em tried ta stab me, I moved out
sold a pound a weed, made g's, bought a new house
i'm only 17, I'm tha new kid
I got me a crew, bought'em jewels, and a uzi
but all good things don't last
task came fast, and busted my black ass
coolen in tha pen, where tha goods kept
now my little brother wants ta follow in my footsteps
a soulja
Chorus
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
Buck, buck, pigs get fucked, don't step ta this
Quiet has kept them blessed, on a quest with a death wish
Tell 'em they come and test, and tha rest, nigga gets hectic
Here's tha aneirexic, i'm making it to an exit
Walkin' through tha streets on tha black tip
Packed with several gats, cause i'm also payin' back shit
Niggas don't wanna try me, brotha you'll get shot down
Now i'm kick'en tha block, cause my bigger brothers locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down
Other cops see me on tha block, and they jock now
That's what I call a kingpin
Send my brotha what he needs is some weed up ta season
Tell him just be ready set, pack ya shit up quick
And when I hit, be prepared ta jet
Niggas from tha block on tha boat now
Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke pow
These punks about ta get hit by tha best
I'm wear'en double vest, so aim at my fuckin chest
I'll be makin' straight dome calls
Touch tha button on tha wall, you'll be picken up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout, hit tha pig nigga
Break your bigga brother out
I got a message for tha warden
I'm commin' for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gorden
We get surrounded in tha mess hall, yes ya'll
A crazy motherfucka makin' death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin
For every minute you stall, one ya'll bleedin'
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walken out, I caught a bullet in tha head
Tha screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gonna pull through, he deserve to
Tha fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following tha tracks of a soulja
Chorus
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted ta be, a soulja, like me
straight soulja, 1993, all of it.







I just don't give a fuck
They done push me to the limit I'm all in
I might blow up any minute, did it again
Now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon
While this cops bragging about the nigga he's baggin
I see no justice
All I see is niggas dying fast
The sound of a gun blast
Then watchin the hearse pass
Just another day in the life 'G'
Gotta step lightly cuz cops tried to snipe me
The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man
But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my cheque
I get more respect from the mutha-fuckin' dope man
The Grammy's and the American music shows pimp us like hos
They got dough but they hate us though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites
They way they see it, we was meant to be keep down
Just can't understand why we getting respect now
Mama told me they're be days like this
But I'm pissed cause it stays like this
And now they trying to send me off to Kuwait
Gimme a break
How much shit can a nigga take
I ain't goin' nowhere, no how
What you wanna throw down
Better bring your guns pal
Cuz this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailin' hate I bail and spray with an A-K
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
from the mutha-fuckin' underground
So step but you better step quick
Cause the clocks goin' tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a phychopath
The truth didn't last
Before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who'd do yah figure!?
A mutha-fuckin night nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up
I had enough and I just don't give a fuck
Niggas!, isn't just the blacks
also a gang of mutha-fuckas dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty
Tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
They say niggas like to do niggas
Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas
A street walkin' nigga and a beat walkin' nigga with a badge
I had to shoot ya and the pass for the blast take his cash
And bash his head in dump him at the dead in
And that's just his luck
Cause a nigga like me
don't really give a fuck
Walked in the store what's everybody staring at
They act like they never seen a muthafucka wearing black
Following a nigga and shit
Ain't this a bitch
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business elsewhere
But where?
Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need?
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if knows that my income is more than
His pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your jive ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mac in fact who's the black jack
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
while he thinks that he's getting over
I bust a move as smooth as casanova
And count another quick meal
I'm getting paid for my traid but its still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
As strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your backs up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Useta come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers stay strong keep yah heads up
They know we fed up
But we they just don't give a fuck
They just don't give a fuck
I gotta give my fuck offs
Fuck you to the San Fransisco police department
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff department
Fuck you to the F.B.I
Fuck you to the C.I.A
Fuck you to the B-u-s-h
Fuck you to the AmeriKKKa
Fuck you to all you redneck prejudiced motherfuckers
And fuck yah
Fuck Y'all
Punk, gay, sensitive, little-dicked bastards
2paclypse mutha fuckin' know
Y'all can kiss my ass and suck my dick
And my uncle Tommy's balls
Fuck Y'all
Punks, punks, punks, punks, punks







They claim that i'm violent
Just cuz I refuse to be silent
These hipocrites are havin' fits
Cuz i'm not buying it, defying it
Envious, because I will rebel against
Any oppressor, and this is known as self defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm tha Lunatic
But when tha shit gets thick, I'm tha one you go and get
Don't look confused, tha truth is so plain ta see
Cause I'm tha nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
And every jeep and and every car, while they stop us
I'm never ignorant, getten goals accomplished
Tha underground railroad on an uprise
This time tha truth is getten told
Heard enough lies
I told'em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate you'll find out where it's coming from
Look through our history, Americas tha violent one
Unlock my brain, break tha chains of your misery
This time tha pay back for evil shit you did too me
They call me militant and racist cause I will resist
You wanna censor something
Mothafucka censor this!
My words are weapons, and i'm stepin to tha sirens
Wakin up tha masses
But you, claim that i'm violent
Chorus
(with tons of scratching in the chorus)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent)
Tha cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by tha police, didn't have my ID
I said, excuse me, why ya tryin ta ride me
He had tha nerve to, say that I had a curfew
Get out tha car, or i'lI hurt you
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my 9 up or hit tha line up
I choose B steped into tha streets
Tha first cop grabbed me, tha other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and threw him to tha concrete
(what ya doin man) they tried ta frame me
They tried ta say I had some dope in tha back seat
But, i'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie packed, he tried ta run
(freeze nigga) I heard a bullet fire from tha cop's gun
My homie dropped, so I hit tha cop
I kept swingin,Yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beaten tha cop senseless
Tha other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
Now i'm against this cop who was racist
Given him a taste, of tradin places
And all this, cause tha peckerwood was tryin this frame up, but I came up
Now they claiming that i'm violent
Chorus
(with tons of scratching in the chorus)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent)
As I was beatin on a cop, I heard a gun click
Then tha gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with tha gun in hand
He shot tha cop, now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us ta get away
They called for back up, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in tha car, and tried ta get away quick
Tha car wouldn't start, we in deep shit
So we jumped out, (come on, let's take tha cops car)
We drove a little ways thinking that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
If I die tonight, i'm dying in a gun fight
I grabbed tha AK, my homie took tha 12 gauge
Load'em up quick, it's time for us ta spray
We'll shot'em up with they own fuckin' weapons
And when we threw spraying, then we stepin
This is a lesson, to tha rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin ass dropped
So here we go, tha police against us
Dark at dusk, and waiting for tha guns ta bust
What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One things for sure, tomorrow I won't be here
But if I go, i'm taken all these punks with me
Pass me a clip G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Given them a reason, (a reason)
Ta claim that i'm violent...
Chorus
(with tons of scratching in the chorus)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want, (Violent)
Fuck a damn cop, (they claim'in that i'm violent)
Just because we play what tha people want....







Killing us one by one
In one way or another
American will find a way to eliminate the problem
One by one
The problem is
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
And one by one
we are being wiped off the face of this earth
At an extremly alarming rate
And even more alarming is the fact
that we are not fighting back
Brothers, sistas, niggas
When I say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
But to me
It means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Acomplishes, nigga
Niggas what are we going to do
Walk blind into a line or fight
Fight and die if we must like niggas
This is for the masses the lower classes
The ones you left out, jobs were givin', better livin'
But we were kept out
Made to feel inferior, but we're the superior
Break the chains in our brains that made us fear yah
Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
Honour a man that who refuses to respect us
Emancipation Proclamation, please!
Lincoln just said that to save the nation
These are lies that we all accepted
Say no to drugs but the governments' keep it
Running through our community, killing the unity
The war on drugs is a war on you and me
And yet they say this is the Home of The Free
But if you ask me its all about hyprocracy
The constitution, Yo, it don't apply to me
Lady Liberty still the bitch lied to me
Steady strong nobody's gonna like what I pumpin'
But its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
So get up, its time to start nation building
I'm fed up, we gotta start teaching childern
That they can be all that they wanna to be
There's much more to life than just poverty
This is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
AMERIKA, AMERIKA, AMERIKKKA
I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
For suppressing and punishing my people
I charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
Trapped in the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
Prosecutor do you have any more evidience
Words of Wisdom
They shine upon the strength of an nation
Conquer the enemy on with education
Protect thy self, reach with what you wanna do
Know thy self, teach what we been through
On with the knowledge of the place, then
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text
Why is that?
Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?
He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated, They act as if asking questions is a crime
But forget it, one day I'm gonna prove them wrong
Now every brother had to smother on the welfare line
The american dream, though it seems it attainable
They're pulling your sleave, don't believe
Cause it will strangle yah
Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came
Swear that your mother is living in equality
Forgeting your brother that's living her apology
Thought they had us beat when they took our kids
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
NIGHTMARE thats what I am
America's nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and evil that you gave me
I shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
for Four hundred plus years
You should be scared
You should be running
You should be trying to silence me
ha ha
But you can not escape fate
Well it is my turn to come
Just as you rose you shall fall
By my hands
Amerika, You reap what you sow
2pacalypse America's Nightmare
Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob America's Nightmare
Above the Law America's Nightmare
Paris America's Nightmare
Public Enemy America's Nightmare
Krs-One America's Nightmare
Mutulu Shakur America's Nightmare
Geronimo Pratt America's Nightmare
Assada Shakur America's Nightmare

Pass the clip, I think I see him comin now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down

Now you're pleadin like a bitch, cause you don't know how to.. hush..
Now back to the smoker that robbed me

Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone

I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get witcha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke til I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit em with
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick

Verse One:
Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Sayin we cousins, knowin that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope gaaaane, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AK's
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call
Verse Two:
It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang cane on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' cane
You got game now you run with no shame
I chose rappin tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go you're not lowly
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
If you need my assistance there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I'd be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call
Verse Three:
Well it's ninety-one and I'm livin kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell pal
But life makin records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected it's hectic it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred, and blurred and changed in shaped
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take, my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face, to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me it's on
No matter who the foe they must fall
Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call







Brenda's (Brenda)
Got a (Got a)
Baby
(Say it one more time, baby)
Brenda's
Got a (Baby)
Baby
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family)
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now, Brenda really never knew her moms, and her dad 
Was a junky, went in debt into his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
(Tupac)
Ohh shit!  Jumped on my man's dick
Heard he had a twelve inch, now the bitch is lovesick
Who's to blame, the guy or the groupie?
Heard I was down with D.U., now she wants to do me
Oooh-wee!  This is the life
New bitch every night, never tripped off a wife
It ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick
Don't try to flip with the lip cause I run shit
Hip hip, hooray for the AK
Spray when I lay competition, what a great day
Make pay, next is the wet sex
Hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex
I'm set, wonder what I tote, check
Bloody as a Kotex, snappin motherfuckers' necks
Revenge so sweet when it comes from
niggaz get done with the drum, watch my foes run
Nigga keeps comin when they can't slip
Full of that shit, another hit from Tha' Lunatic
(Stretch)
Yeah, fuck that God!  Word up
Blowin niggaz out the motherfuckin frame yaknahmsayin?
Constantly.. fuck that trick, we ain't havin it
(Tupac)
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
It's suicidal, you lose your title like Doug-las
Cause I'm nothin nice and, I'm icin like Tyson
I'm grippin the mic and, my DJ is slicin
I'm tired of motherfuckers steppin to me with the SAME OLD
Tryin to do me like Nintendo
How the fuck you think I ever got this far?
By bootin motherfuckers like a shootin star
Cause I'm out to show, that I'm a dope MC
Think crack had you fiendin, wait'll they get a load of me
Bitches on my dick like a motherfuckin condom
Niggaz wanna flip, let em step, and I'll bomb 'em
See somethin you want, why don't you come and get it
And then get waxed and taxed, like the government
Then I leave you sittin there, wonder where your money went
While your bitch is callin me, tellin me to come again
Nigga I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo
But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out
Lookin like a bitch, cause your whole fuckin posse, broke out
Punk motherfucker couldn't roll on
He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
Feel the wrath.. and revenge of Tha' Lunatic
(Stretch)
Yeah Tu', tell them motherfuckers, word up
We ain't havin it, NONE of that shit!!
Bitch ass niggaz, niggaz can't fuck with us Tu', word up
Ninety-one, we takin this WHOLE motherfucker over
Niggaz got PROBLEMS in ninety-one
Ninety-two, and ninety-three
and all that other shit, word up!
(Tupac)
Recognize game when it smacks you, bitch I'm back to rip
Puttin this on the map with this mackin shit
Time will tell if it's made well
Well I raise hell and excel cause it pays well
Jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther
I'm funky, that's word to the father
Act like you know 'fore I thump, the bolo
Thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin for my solo
Oh no, not another new jack, swearin that he's ruthless
Ducked, and now he's fucked and left toothless
I can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared
You're scared and you're bound to go
It's somethin, I guess I let the beat keep bumpin
Stop trippin off these niggaz cause they ain't about nuttin
Or should I say NAYthin
Punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in
I'm sick of the bullshit
Come equipped and get ready to rip
or get the dick of Tha' Lunatic
(Stretch)
Ahhhh yeah!  FUCK THAT!  (the motherfuckin lunatic)
YouknowhatI'msayin?  Yes Tu'!
Tell them niggaz what time it is knahmsayin?
(punk motherfuckers, get the dick of the lunatic)
Niggaz can't fuck with us, word up
Bitch ass niggaz, FUCK EM!
(Tupac)
Fuck all them niggaz
I'm tellin these niggaz that they ain't got..

And all y'all niggaz shit STANK
compared to this shit..
Fuck y'all punk bitches!
Tha' Lunatic
*echoes to fade*







Rebel, rebel, rebel
(2Pac)
They just can't stand the reign
Or the occasional pain
Of a man like me who goes against the grain.
Sometimes I do it in vain
So wit the little bass and treble ain't missed a
So it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel.
Cold as the devil.
Straight from the underground, the rebel alone laughs.
They came to see the maniac sychopath.
The critics heard of me and the aftermath.
I don't give a damn and it shows.
A when I do a stage show I wear street clothes.
So they all know me: the lyrical lunatic, the maniac MC.
I give a shout out to your homies.
Maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G.
On the streets or on TV, it just don't pay the be a truth tellin MC.
They won't be happy till I'm banned.
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man.
For point blank in your face, pump up the bass, and join the human race.
I throw peace to the Bay.
Cuz from the jungle to Oaktown, they backin me up all the way.
You know ya gotta love the sound.
It's from the rebel: the rebel of the underground.
He's the rebel: rebel of the underground (4X)
(2Pac)
Now I'm face to face with the devil.
Cuz they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto.
And police brutality,
Put you in a nip and call it technicality.
So you reap what you soe.
So read the wrath of the rebel jackin em up once more.
Now the fox is in the henhouse.
Creepin up on your daughter, while you asleep
I got her sneakin out.
Tupac ain't nuttin nice.
I'll be nothin how I wanna and do it when I'm gonna.
Now I'm up to no good.
The mastermind of mischief movin more than most could.
So sit and slip into the sound.
Peep the rebel: the rebel of the underground.
He's the rebel: rebel of the underground (4X)
(2Pac)
They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down.
I guess they scared of the rebel: the rebel of the underground.
But I never let it get me.
I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin to sweat me.
In fact, they tryin to keep me out.
Try to censor what I say cuz they don't like what I'm talkin 'bout.
So what's wrong with the media today.
Got brothers sellin out cuz they greedy to get paid.
But me, I'm comin from the soul.
And if it don't go gold, my story still get told.
And that way they can't stop me.
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy.
It's sloppy, don't even try to.
I'm a slave to the rythm and I'm about to fly through.
Sold yo(ya-yo) to the people in the ghetto.
When ya hear the bass roll, go ahead and let go.
Now everybody wanna gangbang.
They talkin street slang, but the punk still can't hang.
By makin records bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent.
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some sellin out, just to get your record out.
But 2pacalpyse is straight down.
So feel the wrath of the rebel: the rebel of the underground.
2pac is the rebel: rebel of the underground (8X)







(cutting and scratching)
She's a part time
a part time
part time
She's a (part time mutha)
A part time
A part time
part time
She's a (part time mutha)
Meet Cindi, she's twenty-two, lives right on the dope track
Used to be fat now weighs less than a Tic-Tac
Now what's that say about, this big epidemic
This hypocritical world, and the people in it
Now speaking of in it Cindi loved to get buckwild
Fuck with a smile single file she'll bust nuff styles
That would be cool, if she was your lover
But fuck that, Cindi was my dope fiend mother
Welfare checks never stepped through the front door
Cuz moms would run to the dopeman once more
All those days, had me fiending for a hot meal
Now I'm a crook, got steel, I do not feel
So don't even trip, when I flip, with my thirty-eight
Revenge is a bitch, and my hit shake the murder rate
Word to the mutha, I'm touched
When moms come by, niggaz hush or get rushed
Maybe one day she'll recover
But what will it take, to shake, or break
My part time mutha
I gotta live with a part time
A part time
A part time
She's a (part time mutha)
A part time
A part time
She's a (part time mutha)
I grew up in a home where no-one liked me
Moms would hit the pipe, everynight, she would fight me
Poppa was a nasty old man, like the rest
He's feeling on my chest, with his hand in my dress
Just another pest, and yes I was nervous
Blood sensor tests, I just don't deserve this
I wanna tell mom, but would she listen
She's bound to be bitchin if she hasn't got a fix in
So... now I lay me down to sleep
Lord don't let him rape me
If he does my soul to keep
Don't let the devil take me
Can't concentrate I contemplate in my classroom
Thinkin how my step dad, raped me in the bathroom
Every day I make class, and yet I'm missing periods
The thought of pregnancy is in my head and now I'm fearing it
I gotta tell mom, before she sees me
I told her how he G'd me, and she didn't believe me
Callin me a slut cuz my butt's kinda big so
Still that ain't no way to be talkin to your kids though
I can't believe the way you call it
Gotta believe in him, and dissin her own daughter
Time for me to break and find another
That's when I discovered
The ways of the days of a part time mutha
I got a part time
A part time
A part time
She's a (part time mutha)
Part time
A part time
A part time mutha
She's a (part time mutha)
I rush to tend her, talked as I touch her
She blushed, the clothes came off, and I bust her
I'm up now, ready to get drunk on the block
Here, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cot
She's gone, and I'm thinkin that my game's so strong
Pat myself on the back and move on
Is this just how it is hell no
Cuz she came back with the kid and yo
I been payin ever since
The clothes the food the cars and oh the rent
All of my time gets spent at the workplace
No time to kiss her got me list in the first place
So I do the dishes and clean the floor
When I sleep I can't dream anymore
Oh no... now I'm a part time mutha
And I, change the diapers and clean the shit
The tables are turned I can't take this
Oh no... now I'm a part time mutha
A part time
A part time mutha
Now I'm a part time mutha
I'm a (part time mutha)
A part time
A part time
Part time
Now I'ma (part time mutha)
She's a part time
A part time mutha
He's a part time mutha
She's a (part time mutha)
A part time
A part time
A part time
Part time mutha
A part time
A part time mutha
Pa-pa-pa-part time
Pa-pa-pa-part time...











Aww yeah, uhh, uhh
Holla if ya hear me, yeah!
(Verse One)
Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatchin hearts and jackin marks
And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
We can have peace someday G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin down the barrel of my nine, get up
Cause it's time to make the payback fat
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got him in a smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' gettin mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin but be thankful that you're livin, blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back
Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'ma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?
You're too near me -
(Chorus)
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
	"Hard!" .. "Tellin you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
	"Tellin you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!

	"Tellin you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
	"Hard!" .. "Tellin you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
	"Tellin you to hear it.."
(Verse Two)
Pump ya fists like this
Holla if ya hear me - PUMP PUMP if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, livin it up
One way or another you'll be givin it up, huh
I guess cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin 'til other brothers bubble -
(Chorus)
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
	"Tellin you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
	"Tellin you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
	"Hard!" .. "Tellin you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
	"Tellin you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!

	"Tellin you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
	"Hard!" .. "Tellin you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
	"Tellin you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
(Verse Three)
Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
representin, never give up, on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise, to all my boyz
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin for the day to let the rage free
Still me, till they kill me
I love it when they fear me -
(Chorus)
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
	"Tellin you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
	"Tellin you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
	"Hard!" .. "Tellin you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
	"Tellin you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
	"Hard!" .. "Tellin you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
	"Tellin you to hear it.."
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
	"Hard!" .. "Tellin you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
	"Tellin you to hear it.."
(2Pac) You're too near me, to see it clearly
(repeat 4x)
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
	"Hard!" .. "Tellin you to hear it, the rebel" - P.E.
	"Tellin you to hear it.."
(repeat 2X)

	"Tellin you to hear it.."
	"Hard!" .. "The rebel"
	"Hard!" .. "The rebel"
(repeat 12X to fade)
(2Pac) Holla if ya hear me!
	"Hard!" .. "The rebel"

"You could get the finger.. the middle!" (1}
	"Come and get some!" (2}
(2Pac)
Ahh yeah, they love to point the finger
(1} (2}
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
(1} (2} Niggaz love to point the finga
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
(1} (2}
(2Pac)
I thought I hit rock bottom, they ban my album, point the finga
I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer
I thought I'd bring a little truth to the young troops
I brought proof that the niggaz need guns too
It's not to be a racist, but let's face this:
wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin major paid
But when I get my check they takin tax out
So, we payin for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Ain't that a bitch, some officers are gettin rich
Whoopin on thugs and robbin drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy, bein a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell em your soul or they'll be on ya til a niggaz ghost
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now how's that for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a law suit, a little kid shot
I play them nuttin ass marks in the park
for tryin to earn they stripes in the dark
Just cause I come there, don't mean I from there, peep:
only jealous motherfuckers beef, and point the finga
Chorus: repeat 4X
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
(1} (2}
(2Pac)
As I run up on em madman, a nutcase with a screw loose
A zoot troupe full of foolies with toolies
Niggaz run to me don't come to me with beef
Take your jewels and your jeep, boom boom!  Let that ass sleep
It's gettin hectic, niggaz run, quick
Buckshots are the payback for dumb shit
All you niggaz on the block tryin to test me
Best wear a vest or get open like, sesame
I'll run up on you mad deep; while you're tryin to sleep
I'm steady pumpin bullets in your sheets
Wake up, motherfucker, don't stutter
Point blank by a nigga from the gutter, yeah!
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme, mine
Ban my rhymes, now I'm back to bustin, nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell no
A quick flurry and he's buried with a swelled jaw
I came up from the amateurs to pro hits
at 5-0, so you know I take no shit
And everybody wants to kill a bringer
of bad news, so they choose, to point the finga
Chorus
(2Pac)
One two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I bring skills and I build, kill at will
Smoke sess til I'm ill, still feel me?
I say one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
Pick it up, pick it up, give it up
Best to duck or get fucked for your bucks
Scream one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I can't give up, it's a black thang
And I ain't goin back to the crack game
(You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Bitches, let em point the finga
(You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Snitches, let em point the finga
Yo, one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I guess nobody loves a rap singer
That's why these motherfuckers.. (hahaha!) point the finga
Chorus
Chorus
Chorus 3/4







(laughter echoed)
I've changed...
You mothafuckas kill me
I've changed...
It ain't that i've changed
But it's strange how you mothafuckas rearrange
When I found fame
Point ya finger at tha bad guy
You know what my momma usta tell me
If ya can't find something ta live 4
Then you best, find something ta die 4
(Eazy saying 'if there's hell below, we're all gonna go') 
Repeats through interlude 
Deep deep
La'tasha Hardings
Remember that name...
Cause a bottle of juice...
Is not something 2 die 4
Young Quaid
Remember that name...
Cause all you mothafuckas
That go to your grave with that name on your brain
Cause jelousy and recklousness
Is not, something 2 die 4
All you Niggas out there
(echoed laughter)
Got a crack that crumbles
When I say all you Niggas (all you niggas)
Unite
One nigga, teach 2 niggas
4 niggas teach more niggas
All tha poor niggas
Tha penn niggas
Tha rich niggas
Tha strong niggas
Unite
There's more of us than there is of them
Look around...
Check your strip
Deep deep
That's something 2 die 4
Black
That's something 2 live 4
What do I know?

Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dred, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga
But they can't take us alll
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place (ha ha ha)
Keeping the smile off their white fakes
I ain't racist but lets trade places
Trace the hate 'n face it
One nigga teach two niggas
three teach four niggas
And them niggas teach more niggas
And when we blast
That'll be the biggest blast you've heard
And them is my last wordz

Couldn't be my sister if she actin like I missed her.
Tell me why they, tell me why they, tell me why they play me.
Don't these niggas know that neither one of y'all can fade me.
I ain't big, I ain't buff, I ain't diesel.
But fuck wit Tupac and pop goes the weesel.

Would jack a motha fuckin real nigga cuz they jealous.
They do it for the fame.
Explain. Insane. What's in a name? What's in a name?

*Na, that's just a hooch looking for some juice.
-What's up my nigga? What ya know? A nigga got a little bigger.
That's all folks know.
No Fat gold ropes.
Gotta keep a low key for my attack.
When I approach, I want the diamonds, the pearls.
The round the way girls.
Cuz baby got, baby got back out this world.
Would you give a fee? Never.
Fly like a feather.
Make more money than your daddie and your mother put together.
The game is to be sold, not to be told.
So buy it.
Can't afford it?
Low budget hoes gotta brother.
Peep game.
Chorus 
Don't sell out.

Tupac, Threat, Bobcat.
93 shot.
Yeah nigga, bitch







Eat a dick up
Chorus (Rakim):
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
still don't nothin move but the money (2x)
Verse One: Live Squad
Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the black man
Eatin the scams like I was motherfuckin Pac Man
Cops step off, you know the flavor
They fear the ruffneck niggaz with the lunatic behavior
And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet
Stabbin for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin streets
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy
I rhyme and do crimes, cuz either way pays me
A little rough with a hardcore... theme
Couldn't rough something rougher in your... dreams
Mad rugged so you know we're gonna... rip
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse
Representing YG'z yo
Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino
Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags
Stickin up spots and jumpin in Jags
Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin
And always keep a hand on the gat
Cuz a niggaz straight strugglin
Chorus (Rakim):
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
still don't nothin move but the money (2x)
Verse Two: Live Squad
I used to be on tour, but now I'm sick of strugglin
I thought about bumpin, but mother-fuck jugglin
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uhh! it's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
Cuz of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac cause the dog got it goin on
If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin in a ditch
You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game
I'm strugglin
Chorus (Rakim):
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
still don't nothin move but the money (2x)
Verse Three: 2Pac
Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothin changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggaz on they back
Till I call back, niggaz runnin free better fall back
I'm fifty niggaz deep beat sleep
with a Mossberg wrapped in my seats
three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin motherfuckers to the moon
Niggaz need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin
See me on the block, strugglin
And rollin with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed
I get in niggaz ass, blast
Straight strugglin
Chorus (Rakim):
Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
still don't nothin move but the money (Repeats)







Guess who's back? 
(2Pac) 
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got 
two minutes to bounce, and every second counts 
Better press, wreck on your tech, here we go, set pass the Moet 
My trickery's more slippery when wet 
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip 
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit 
Everybody's got a mic now, its like a hobby 
But more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin to rob me 
And little man wants to be a rap, star 
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car 
It ain't easy, sleazy even 
Decievin those we, believe in 
No benefits, just tricks and chicks 
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick 
I shoot a gift, til there ain't none left 
And if I find that the track sound deaf 
I catch wreck till I lose my breath 
That's how it goes in the land of broke 
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough 
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why? 
I say, Hi, and try to stay high 
Life's a mess don't stress, test.. of givin 
but be thankful that you're livin.. blessed 
Guess who's back, comin back with the track supplied 
by Special Ed and Ak, comin right and exact 
I'm fightin it back, now snap, where they at? 
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back 
Chorus: repeat 4X 
Yes I'm back -> Special Ed 
Tupac is .. back!! 
(2Pac) 
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got 
one minute to bounce, and every second counts 
I went from hustlin dicks, to makin hits, bustin flicks 
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six 
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes 
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date 
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break 
Good thoughts I wait, cause they hate my black take 
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race 
But if ya got a black face, its a rat race 
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes 
Tryin to survive in the trials and lawsuits 
Everybody wants to test me, why me? 
No lie, nuckas cried when they try me 
Givin up the roughness, justice 
I'ma bust as I'm rippin up 'nuff hits 
And guess who's back? No longer trapped 
Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact 
Ride the track, get I grip as I flip 
Ghetto wickedness I kick, guess who's back? 
Chorus 1.5X 
Yes I'm back, cause I never did front -> cut 'n' scratched







I got a head, but ain't no screws in it. 
Roll up and get swoll up.
Hold up.
How ya gonna play me like a sunkin dunkin donut?
I ain't came a long way to get checked 
So give me respect when I get wreck or 
get your motha fuckin chimp check.
Once again, it's your friend outta Oakland.
Hoping I rock the shit to get ya open.
Say your looking for some real shit.
Then catch a funkdified batch.
Like that!!
Oakland's on the map.
Tupac is on the big screen strivin.
Gotta love a nigga for survivin.
I wear alot of old schools jewels.
Little somethin for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corrine
Verse One:
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uhh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin to gas ya up, I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up
Chorus
Ooooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooooh child things are gonna get brighter
Ooooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooooh child things are gonna get brighter
Verse Two:
Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it's funny when it rains and pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
They say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
there ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up
Chorus
Verse Three:
And uhh
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don't fall down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getten older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
I'm still tryin to hold on to survivin friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
please... you got to keep your head up







Yo 'Law, is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one?
Yeah, Mr.Fuck-a-Cop is back and I still don't give a fuck yaknahmsayin'
Puffin on this indo, in the studio with my partners out here
Pacific Heights in the house, know what I mean
I was framed, so don't make the same mistake, nigga
You gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga
'Cause the police love to break a nigga
Send 'em upstate cause they straight-up hate the niggaz
So what I do is get a crew of zoo niggaz
Straight fools into rules and do niggaz
And one-time had enough of me
I'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me
They wanna send me to the pen, punk picture that
I stay strapped motherfuckers better get your gat
It ain't easy bein' me I can't take it
Life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it
And ever since the movies, these hoes try to do me
If they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me
Now, can you picture me coolin' at a night club?
Nothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
Since I wear a lot of gold, they plot
Don't know what I got and get shot with the hot ones
And aww yeah, I wanna feel guilty
But you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
You'll get smacked behind the hill with my phone on my pager
It's beepin' while I cut you with my razor
I'm not violent, I'm petrified and nervous
I got no mercy for these niggaz tryin' to serve us
But if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got
You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop, now drop it
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's
Reflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected
You're just another rapper who swears he's makin' records
That's what they said whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though always kept my head up high
Eventually, I knew that I would find my way
After the darkest night, always comes a brighter day
And some would say that turned away is all you'll get
I just said, bet, and never let 'em see me sweat
'Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all
While non-believers were prayin' for my downfall
And some would call and tell me that they wish me well
But in my heart, I'm knowin' that they wish me hell
Yo get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent
I hate the studio 'cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it 'til you hit the top
And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you and that way you can never fall
But beware these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car, nope
And when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed
Remember how it felt, and then remember this
Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
'Cause they can all suck dick, it's strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my niggaz makin' G's
Listen, this is for the critics if you live up
Pick up my shit or I'll be back doin' stickups
I better see five stars next to my picture
If not Tupac will cop the glock and come knockin' to getcha
I told you once motherfucker I'm a nut
Play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin' when you're fucked
Niggaz know what's up but they be tryin' to hold me down
I'm comin' outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around
And it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore
Nigga, it's the way you throw them thangs in the war
And to the marks that be talkin all that shit
Screamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch
And the niggaz that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches should've pulled the fuckin' trigga
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass, nigga
Mr.Troublesome, niggaz tried to play me with the gat
But like Terminator nigga, I'll be back
Yeah, and I'll be back with a fuckin' army
You tried to harm me, ruh-ring the alarm G!
'Cause most motherfuckers love to act up
Without they backup, when they get jacked up they crack up
It's strictly for my niggaz at the show
So they know, not to play me like a ho-ho, strictly 4 my
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz
Strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my, strictly 4 my niggaz

Growing up as an inner city brotha
where every other had a pops and a motha
I was tha product of a heated lover
Nobody knew how deep it screwed me
and since my pops never knew me
my family didn't know what ta do with me
was I somebody they despise
curious look in they eyes
as if they wonder if i'm dead or alive
poor momma can't control me
quit tryin' ta save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies
a ticken timebomb
can't nobody fade me
packin' a 380
and fiendin' for my mercedes
suckers scatter
but it don't matter i'm a cool shot
punks drop from all tha buckshots tha fools got
i'm tired of being a nice guy
i've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why
so they label me a lunatic 
could care less
death or success
is what I quest
cause i'm fearless
now tha streetz R Deathrow
Chorus
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
tha streetz R Deathrow
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
tha streetz R Deathrow
I just murdered a man, i'm even more stressed
wearin' a vest
hopein' that their aimin' at my chest
much too young to bite tha bullet
hand on tha trigga 
I see my life before my eyes each time I pull it
I hope I live to be a man
must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in tha state
penn
counting pennys over tha years
I'd done stacked many
proven wrong those
who swore i'd wouldn't live till twenty
now they gotta cope
since it's tha only thing I know
it's difficult to let it go
i'm startin' to loose my hair cause I worry
hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried
but now I gotta move away now
cause these suckers wanna spray where I lay down
my homie lost his family and snapped
shot up half tha block to bring them back
tha streetz R Deathrow
Chorus
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')

tha streetz R Deathrow
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
(like it ain't nothin')
i'm dangerous
when drunk I only drink beer
gin makes me sin
unable to think clear
heneesee, makes me think my enemy is getting close
BOOM BOOM BOOM 
got me shooting at a ghost
some call me crazy
but this is what you gave me
amongst tha babies, who raised up from tha slavery
I sport a vest and hit tha sess to kill tha stress
moved out west and I invest in all tha best
those who test will find a bullet in they chest
put ta rest
by a brotha who was hopeless
grow up broke on tha rope of insanity
how many pistols smoking coming from a broken family
i'm sick of being tired
sick of tha sirens, body bags, and tha gun firing
tell bush to push tha button cause i'm fed
tired of hearin' these voices in my head
tha streetz R Deathrow

There got to be a better way...
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
There's too many of us in tha cemetary
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
I love it when they fear me

I love it when they fear me

Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
Stronger than ever
(Tupac)
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around
What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know
(Shock G)
Now you can tell from my everday fits, I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around
(Money B)
What's up love, how you doing? (All right)
Well I've been hanging sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging
Your home girl you went to school with, that's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know, that I get around
(Tupac)
2Pacalypse now don't stop for hoes, I get around
Why I ain't call you? Ha ha, please
Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down?
I get around
(Shock G)
Round and round, round we go (Repeat 8x)







Daddy's home...
(2Pac)
Heh, so??
You say that like that means somethin to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
for you to be comin home talkin that "daddy's home" shit (nigga)
We been gettin along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS.. fuck you!
(2Pac)
Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
the things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
so when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...
(Chorus)
I'm so sorry
for all this time (I'm so sorry)
for all this time
for all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
for all this time (so, sorry)
for all this time
for all this time, so sorry baby!
(Wycked)
Moms had to entertain many men
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father
Should I stay or run away, tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his poppa wasn't man enough
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother
(That's when I started hatin the phony smiles
Said I was an only child)
Look at mama's lonely smile
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...
(Chorus)
I'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time
for all this time
I'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time (so sorry)
for all this time, so sorry baby!
(2Pac)
Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh -I guess ya didn't know 
that I would grow to be so strong
Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale oh pops was wrong
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
but it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that "wanna be your father" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G
Now that that I finally found you, stay the Fuck away from me
You're so sorry..
(Chorus)
I'm so sorry (so sorry)
for all this time (so, so sorry)
for all this time (I'm so so sorry)
for all this time (fuck that!)
I'm so sorry
for all this time (no)
for all this time (so sorry)
for all this time, so sorry baby!
(Tupac - impersonating his father)
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was in danger
If I was to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
Had to move, one to lost my name and pick the number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast
But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
all I ever wanted was for you to be a man
and grow to be the type you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry...
(Chorus w/ variations til end







Yeah hehehahaha, we goin platinum nigga!  Plaahahatinum.
(Stretch)
Yeah, you got the Live Squad in this motherfucker
We got my nigga Treach from Naughty by Nature in this motherfucker
My nigga Apache up in this motherfucker
(Verse One: 2Pac)
My Mossberg goes boom, gimme room, can I catch it
Talkin quick and then I vic just tryin to keep from gettin blasted
I had enough I put a hit upon them bastards
Boo-yaa!  Turned a snitch into a casket
Now they after me, prowling for a niggaz bucks
Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
Buck buck, big up and livin reckless
Niggaz with a death wish step in with a Tec and I'll wet this
Yeah this shit is hyper
Two to one I'm writing representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong arm must run
Some niggaz need to feel me with a passion
I'm old fashioned, run up on me nigga and get blasted
With five deadly venomz
(Stretch)
Yeah 'Pac, fuck that, still hittin em up with
That old deadly shit.  Aiyyo Treach where you at?
Step up and hit they ass up with the wickedness.
(Verse Two: Treach)
We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
To the Onyx of your nose, punk is funky like skunk blunts
Stunk like funk cunt
I come to take you on a war rough and rugged route
And if another doubts I blow your fuckin mother out
And that's the street scarred style
I shout I'm-de-MC-wit-de-nasty-mouf, and kick the bitch out
Sue me?  I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin pounds more
I take you quicker than a picture of a punk ya pickin shit
Pickin pockets with a razor stoppin Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin shop
Once you sound hot, cause if you ain't a perfect ten
My sign is stop!
It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin styles in em
Like women I did em I'm in for deadly ready venom
(Verse Three: Majesty of Live Squad)
Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Maj
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin em down, I make em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
Rob and steal and runnin from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Mac-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make you scatter, leavin trails of brains and bladders
Blowin em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, somethin that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit em, I lit him
He's out!  A poison, a deadly venom
(Stretch)
Yeah Maj, fuck that!  You know how we do.
KnowhatI'msayin?  Squad in effect, YG'z in effect.
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent
(Verse Four: Stretch of Live Squad)
Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggaz can't touch me when I wreckin G you better flee
Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uhh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking over eight niggaz back to the stomping grounds
Line em up single file, dome runnin in em
A nigga hit em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom
(Stretch)
Nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin?  Fuck that!
I told you, we takin over, yo 'Pac.
(Verse Five: 2Pac)
Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggaz don't even worry me, see
I got a glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops cause my gauge gets me... PAID
As I sit and reminesce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey
I say niggaz need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I past let the glass spray
First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now you're mouth's full of chunks, Pac's out puffin blunts
Deadly venomz
(Stretch)
Hahaha, yeah pass that shit over here.
Apache bout to clean shit up.
(Verse Six: Apache)
Throw up your middle finger!  Start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'ma snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fuckin trigger
I'm a section to clinch your porch is like a pinch
Test a rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch
Fuckin up pooh-butts, cut em like cold cuts
Choke em with my boot lace, then leave em hangin like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get em
That's the results of fuckin with the fifth venom in denim
(Stretch)
Yeah, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Five motherfuckin deadly venomz, in effect for ninety-three
Ninety-four ninety-five all that other shit.
We takin this motherfucker over this larger hit.
YaknowhatI'msayin?  Follow us, come along.  YaknowhatI'msayin?
We takin this motherfucker over.  TRUST.  We out.

[Mopreme Shakur]
More Trouble than tha average
just made 25 and i'm livin' like a savage
bein a G ain't no easy thing
cause you could fuck around get crossed 
and get stuck in tha game
and for tha rest of your life you will sit and reminicse
wonder why it had to end like this
and to tha G's you can feel my pain
till tha mothafucka gets born again
[The Rated R]
you thought I was a game kid
i'm not tha nigga for playin games
I let my buckshots rang
when I pull tha trigga on my gauge
i'm on a rampage
makin' runs for tha devil
ain't nothin' on my mind
but gettin in some trouble
i'm tryin to ride 
no more loves 
for me hard to figure

Or in some jewelry store (break that shit)
I gives a fuck nigga

when I bust
put me to my death
but i'm a G til the end of me
Chorus (x2):
I ain't got time for bitches
gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
even when I die
they won't worry me
mama don't cry

[Big Syke]
I got nothin' ta loose so I choose to be a killer
went from bangin' and slangin'
now i'm a dope dealer
all my life payed tha price to be tha boss
back in school

poppin' rocks on tha block was a past time
pack a 9 all the time
you wanna test mine?
don't cry
I die before they play me
from tha cradle to tha grave
bury me
Straight up
kickin' it with tha homies in tha hood
gettin' drunk, smokin' blunts
a bitch said I'm no good
I gives a fuck
I spend my time in a dope spot 
never had no time for no bitch 
just slangin' rocks
and bustin' caps on your punk ass marks
fake ass G's
bitch niggaz with no heart
i'm stayin' real till i'm 6 feet deep
so when a nigga gone
bury me a G
Chorus (2x):
I ain't got time for bitches
gotta keep my mind on my mothafuckin riches
even when I die
they won't worry me
mama don't cry
Bury Me a G 
[2pac]
Stuck on Full
Tangaray got a nigga high
lord knows I don't need another DUI
I led a Thug Life
heartless hustler
just cause I fucked

so i'm mobbin' to tha ho's house
pumpin' Isely

Bitch recognize game and start laughin
when i'm all in those guts and shit (Nigga you crazy)
prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
cause i'll fuck and get up and let ya know

Chorus:

Gotta Keep my mind on my mothafucken riches

Mama don't cry

I ain't got time for bitches
bitches







(Mopreme)
Just 'cause a nigga come in he got style
Don't think I won't flip it
Don't pull your file
But I got enough bullshit to deal with
I'm rollin' with the thugs so
You must be on drugs to the head
Get your ass break down 
Broken half baby
I'm a feelin' like a motherfuckin psychopathic
And if you got beef best leave it in the freezer
I'm no joke
Mopreme straight loc
And you could get smoked
You hook the shit you get stroked 
And all of that
And later be back for your motherfuckin dope sack
Kid it ain't the type of day to play doughnut
Don't get your ass sewn up
Why you leakin on my blown out
Hey, you're mixed up like a bowl of nuts
You fuck around and got it twisted up
Boy, don't get it twisted
(chorus)
Don't get it twisted!..... (8x)
(Macadoshis)
It's the Macadoshis coming from the dark side
The park side where the O.G.s do ride
Ain't nothing but killers in the park
As many niggas lost they's heart
When my gat sparks
I'll bust a cap in that ass
Don't get it twisted
When I'm on a mission, niggas come with Mishy
You busters gettin disciplined
And you're comin' up short on your life
When i smoke you with this mac-10 
When it's on it's on 
Fuck it 
I'm makin niggas kick the bucket when I check em' by inducis
Ain't no think to let my shit spin
You on my shit list hope you got a death wish
I tried to warn you but you missed me
You should have listened motherfucker when i said:
Don't get it twisted!
(chorus)
Don't get it twisted!..... (6x)
(Rated R)
Niggas got problems about gettin shit twisted 
They need to stay the fuck out of grown folks business
Kids get a kick out of bumpin their big clips
But don't front no shit that brought no shit that peace started 
Cause I'm a cold hearted rider straight dunkin'
never through with my streets
Never hurt nobody but my heat
East side brothers don't hear me though
They'd rather get shit twisted and gather like hoes
Bitch make ass niggas when I caught 'em
Couldn't bust a drape if they wanted
They're soft like Charmin 
But I don't sweat varmits
I suffer with my black group 
Just a one-day murderer
On the motherfuckin Rudy Poop
I snapped his soul, son
Ain't no damn thing funny when I spray your ass with my tongue
And your mommy can't save you now
Cause you got the job twisted up
For fuckin' with a killer
(chorus)
Don't get it twisted!..... (8x)
(fade out)







You can dance at the party and not get whipped
(2pac)
Shit don't stop (2x)
Game rules often slang to the right fools
Heavy hittin' at this motherfucker's straight spittin'
Diggin' deep into your brain while tryin to explain
why real niggas need to stick to the game
It's the same got these motherfuckers changin' on me
Jealous-ass player-haters gaming on me
Look out motherfucker homey-G
As in gettin' motherfuckers 'fore they come get me
Get down for the right for the wishes
Fake ass nigga, you in shit, for fightin' over bitches
You call that a player?
Straight-ass sissy
See me at my show nigga miss me
Cause I ain't tryin' to hear that bullshit
Got a pistol motherfucker better pull quick
And just cause i'm rappin don't mean I ain't scrappin
And if you clip when the shit happens, it don't stop
(chorus) Shit don't stop...
(Y.N.V)
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped
(Macadoshis)
See the shit don't stop
My 9 goes pop
Your body drip-drop
Throw that ass in a zip-loc
(Rated R)
Now you've been hauled away in a body bag
Get your Sammy D said how your blood got sneeze me
(Macadoshis)
Yo you fuckin' with a thug yo your ass gets plugged
With this hollow-point slugs
With ya under the rug
(Rated R)
That's why my deaf niggas don't play that shit
In thug life niggas be the craziest
(Macadoshis)
So when you think about fuckin' this
You better wear a vest
But it really don't matter
We ain't aimin' at your chest
(Rated R)
Nah we blowin holes in your motherfuckin' skull
Make sure your ass is smoked
That's all the fat lady wrote
(Macadoshis)
You heard that fat bitch sing when my shit went bang-bang
But it don't pay when i flaunt your brain
(Rated R)
Nigga, ain't no plain cane brothers come no show
In the casket
Git'n they ass kicked
And blasted
It don't stop
(chorus) Shit don't stop...
(Y.N.V)
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped
(Mopreme)
All I wanna do is try to Mac the hoes
Spin bank on thangs sellin me a sponsor on my foes
It's like each and every one they got the look of death
I got my 9 nigga
Don't be silly
You better watch your step
(Syke)
And pussies we crossin when my crew is flossin'
Bitches we tossin'
And niggas we crossin'
It's like a murder rhyme when we hit your hood
It's all good
The punks? I wish you would!
(Mopreme)
Wouldn't better to just corrolate what we bust
Instead of kickin' dust
Gets a press y'all from nuts
Cause ain't no herbs here
And ain't no morgues
Beware of the water 'cause they full of sharks
(Syke)
But in every state
Niggas perpetrate and test
Where I come from fools die for less
And thugs keep thugin' till their casket drop
It's on 'till I die
And the shit don't stop
(chorus 2x) Shit don't stop...
(Y.N.V)
Now my guess is true
Them thug life niggas is a bull
Everywhere we go
The niggas trippin at the door
I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped







Yeah
Pour out a little liquor for your homies, nigga
This one here go out to my nigga Mike Coolie
(Light up a fat one for this one)
How you come up, man?
I started young kickin' dust and livin' rough
You watch you mouth around my mama, you couldn't cuss, man
I had a down ass homie though we ran the streets
And on the scene at the age of fourteen, huh
I packed a nine and my nigga packed a forty-five
We drinkin' forties, lil' shorties livin' naughty lives
You couldn't stop us, long as I got my glock, fuck the coppers
Hangin' on the block, slangin' rocks and makin' profits
I couldn't fuck with the school life, I was a fool
I'll play that motherfucker for a tool man
Tonight'll be the night that's what we figurin'
Hustlin' in the rain felt no pain 'cuz we drinkin'
Playin' them hoes like manure
First let my nigga fuck and then I fuck, that's how we do it
(Ha ha)
It's two niggaz comin' up out the hood
Livin' life just as good as we could
But since a bitch can't be trusted
Hoes snitched to the police, now my nigga's busted
The cops whoopin' on my nigga in jail
Tryin' to get a motherfucker to tell
And couldn't nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga, pour out a little liquor
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
This goes out to all you so called G's
Pour out a little liquor for your real motherfuckin' partners
Don't let the drink get like that y'all, huh
Pour out a little liquor, pour out a little liquor
What's that you drinkin' on?
Drinkin' on gin, smokin' on blunts and it's on
Reminisce about my niggaz, that's dead and gone
And now they buried, sometimes my eyes still get blurry
'Cuz I'm losin' all my homies and I worry
I got my back against a brick wall, trapped in a circle
Boxin' with them suckers 'til my knuckles turn purple
Mama told me, "Son, there'll be days like this"
Don't wanna think so, I hit the drink and stay blitzed
We had plans of bein' big time G's
Rolling in marked cars, movin' them keys
And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo
Get to' down for my niggaz in the pen, yo
Your son's gettin' big and strong
And I'd love 'em like one of my own, til' you come home
And the years sure fly with the quickness
You do the time, and I'll keep handlin' yo' business
That's the way it's supposed to be
Homie, if it was me, you'd do the shit for me
Homie, I can remember scrapin' back to back
Throwin' dogs on them suckers runnin' up on this young hog
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture
And let ya know how much a nigga miss ya
Pour out some liquor
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
Look at you
Drinkin' got you where you don't even give respect to your partners
Pour out some liquor, nigga
It ain't like that, tip that shit over
Pour out a little liquor
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
My cousin died last year and I still can't let go
This for my nigga Madman, Dagz, Hood, Silk, yeah
A little liquor for my homies y'all
We in this motherfuckin' piece, yeah
Pour out a little liquor, Young Queen, yeah
This one goes out to all my mack partners
Back in the motherfuckin' Bay
Oaktown still in the motherfuckin' house
(Pour out a little liquor)
My nigga Richie Rich, Gov'na
(I don't care, Night train, Hennessey)
All my real motherfuckin' partners
(Pour out a little liquor)
And all my real partnas in Marin, fuck you busta ass niggaz
Yeah nigga, pour out a little liquor

Havin' big dreams of gettin' richer

Chorus (4x) (Tupac)
Thug Life, y'all know the rules

Thug Life

Shakin' the dice, we roll long, ain't nothin' nice
so the vice wanna follow us around (raize up)
Got 'em runnin' as we clown thru the town (blaze up)
Another one, had to throw another gun
Don't need another case
you can see it on my face son
But I ain't fallin' yet
And I gotta give a shout to where my ball is at
(Tupac)
Mophreme Tell 'em why the hoes dream
gettin high off a nigga like a dope fiend
(Mophreme)
Cuz I'm non-stop, and I'm always hustlin'
twenty four seven, ain't nothin buck
but when a young G's flippin keys for a livin'
Try to make a mill off the time I'm givin'
trippin'

I'm crazy
Can't nobody fade me
And I been goin' insane lately
And everybody tryin ta hold me back
I'm about to snap

Thug Life, Thugs for life
Ha Ha yeah, how long will they mourn me

2Pac in this muthafucka
(Tupac)
All my homies drinking liquor
Tears in everybody's eyes 
Niggas cried to mourn a homies homicide
But I can't cry 
instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckas back before your buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a 187 
(Tupac)
Under Pressure
Yeah, Babyyy
When tha pressures on...
Thug Life
when it's on it's on
(Tupac)
One of these days i'll learn
don't fuck with trick ass niggas
cause they turn into bitch ass niggas
i'm sick of bein stuck in tha county jail
my niggas clown, bring a pound
when they posten bail
smokin' blunts in tha driveway
my four-five screamin fuck tha police
won't fly away, thug, till I die
you wonder why I'm made this way
I wasn't, turned out
I was raised this way of thinkin
these are tha dreams of a young teen
sceam, and stack green on tha crack fiends
one time can't hold me one of these days
we gotta bust back for tha homies
locked down in tha penitentry
finally loose my mind if tha pigs succeed
stress, smoken weed and nicoteen
but what a nigga really need is Thorozine
right before I die i'll be curseing tha law
reincarnated bitch even worse than before
my four-four's givin payback
my underhanded plan
to get them niggas while they laid back
and big stretch hit tha scene with tha mini 14
servin suckers like dope fiends 
and lead tha whole team
Under Pressure Nigga
That's right
(Stretch)
Never run throw your gun in tha air
oh yeah nigga bust ain't no time to spare
called tha ruffest mothafucker and we fuck shit up
and with tha stainless steel (???), we cut shit up
flash and blast a nigga with tha quickness
cock tha four pound motherfucker when I spit this and rip this
damn, my mind is in tha depths of hell
but when i'm walking on tha street kid my name rings bells
and I never fell nigga I stand to tall
i'm just a thug motherfucker who was born to brawl, givin my all 
so niggas wanna bring it to me
so i'ma sell my cocain and lay they ass down 'G'
Under Pressure
(Tupac)
yeah, look here tho
Runnin wild
I never smiled as a juvenile
even now I keep a frown when I come around
don't ask me about tha past, it was all bad
shots blasted will I last in tha wrong path
in tha dark is where my heart saw tha most grief
mothafuckers is getten shanked over gold teeth
am I sick? cause i'm addicted to get splifted
watch tha stupid ass tricks get lifted
nothens changed cause in tha came it's a steady aim
fuck friends cause when in danger those niggas change
puff weed and stuff G's in my sock G
call Ki's and Hennessy where tha glock be
Times passen will I last here another day
I put my gun away and grab my AK
it's getten hectic I can't call it
house full of alcoholics
now we're niggas under pressure
yeah, that's right...
Under Pressure, we're niggas under pressure
yeah
(Tupac and Stretch together repeated 11x)
When tha Pressures on it's a hit
Ski mask
Extra Gats
bring tha clips
don't nobody move when we walk tha streets
they stay silent 
cause talk is cheap







(Mopreme)
It was a dope spot front yard, one on one strapping
That's the way it was way before all the scrapping
Earned my fucking props from the G's in the hood
Put in work, did some dirt, never snitched, never would
Rollin the fat Jaguars with my nigga P blowing up
Time coming back sipping Hennessey
Seventeen years old and I felt like God mad rich
And I had my pick of any fine bitch
And my family was known to be great, seen slightly more
Representing no matter who sets it on
Street power, why you niggaz flip and you thug shit
I be bout my motherfucking grip, nothing else
gets between me and mine, just remember that
Damn it's a shame, but still I'm in the game
I'm trying to get street fame
(Chorus)
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar..
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar..
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
(Big Syke)
Don't blame my mama, don't blame my daddy
I know they wish they never had me
In and out of jail by twelve, failing out of school
Cause I was living by the street rules
Hanging with hogs, dropping dogs as a little loc
I was getting my respect but I was still broke
Into the game and expanded to the cocaine
Went from double-ups, to slanging them whole things
Focused on my mail name ringing like a bell
And even with no proof they gonna put me in jail 
Everybody says he's sold and I'm outta control
Motherfuckers gossip but I still roll (nigga)
Bitches want my cash on my dash of my cockpit
They wouldn't know a motherfucker if he didn't have shit
So while I'm balling and kicking up dust, get yo' skull crushed
Bitch-made niggaz know not to fuck with us
Cause I'm living on the edge, I'm blasting lead
Wanted by the Feds, they got to take me dead
So fuck it drive a bucket in the inner city
In the land of no pity, I made it by the street fame
(Chorus) - 2X
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar..
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar..
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
(The Rated R)
I'm a super star, made it by street fame
I had to make some people feel the pain, in this dirty game
I know I'm on my way to hell
Ain't no yellow bricked road for all the niggas that I done smoked
The hood done took me under, a nigga gots no heart
Don't get it twisted cause I'm there with my homey's car
I kill for my niggaz, my niggaz kill for me
That's the love you get, from the drunk one, you put in work see
I'm a G with a gang of niggaz after me
Trying to peal me, cause I smoked they homey
What comes around goes around is what makes it worse
I smoke blunts all day to keep my mind off a hearse
They don't stop stop till my casket drop drop
Let me ride, but all I want, thou shalt not beef or die
And it don't matter if I rap or plays
Cause I blow out back of some minds, fuck the fame
(Chorus)
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar..
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
I'm a superstar.., I'm a superstar..
I'm a superstar, made it by street fame
.. made it by street fame
(repeat to the end)







(Chorus) 
From tha Cradle to the Grave, life ain't never been easy 
Living in the ghetto. OohOooh 
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy 
Living in the ghetto. 
June 16, 1971 
Mama gave birth 
to a hell raisin' heavanly son. 
See the doctor tried to smack me 
but I smacked him back, 
My first words were thug for life 
and Papa pass the Mak. 
I'm bustin' on these motha fuckas ballin' 
Listen you can hear my mini 14 callin'. 
From out the window of my drop top 
I got my glock cocked 
bustin' at niggas 
I would share the definition of ballin' with you white folks... 
but now... 
the game is to be sold and not told 
So eh, fuck me 
(Tupac) 
I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block. 
Little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks. 
Learn to throw them thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked. 
And niggas laugh, til' tha first mothafucka got blasted. 
I put the nigga in his casket, 
Now they coverin' the basket with plastic. 
I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts. 
I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce. 
And gettin' ghost on the five-o, fuck them hos. 
Got a 45 screamin' about survival. 
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some yay-yo. 
Hollar one-time when I say so. 
Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences. 
Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches. 
And they say how do you survive weighin' 165 
In a city where the skinny niggas die? 
Tell Mama don't cry. 
Even when they kill me, 
They can never take the game from a young G. 
I'm str8 ballin'! 
Str8 ballin'! 
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin' 
pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it. 
But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'. 
It's kinda boomin' round the way and today I'll make a killin'. 
Dressin' down like a villian', but only on the block. 
It's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops. 
Ha, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends. 
I'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz. 
I hate to strip let my music bump, 
Drinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck. 
Rather die makin' money than live poor and legal 
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo. 
A need money in a major way. 
Time to fuck my BEEEYATCH!! Hey!, and getten' paid 
You other mothafuckas callin', 
But me and my mothafuckin' thug niggas, 
We str8 ballin'!! 
Str8 ballin'! 
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do. 
So watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to RAISE UP! 
But don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes 
Young nigga time to do or die. 
I keep a pistol in my pocket, 
Ready on my block. 
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit. 
And now they see that mothafucka beat pain, 
At point blank range cause he slept on the game. 
Ain't a damned thing changed 
Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em, 
If you can't stand pain better hold 'em. 
Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll. 
You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold. Nigga. 
Better live your life to the fullest, 
You 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol mothafucka better pull it. 
Cause even when they kill me, 
they can never take the game from a young G. 
We str8 ballin'! 
We str8 ballin'! 
To my niggas in the penitentiary, 
Loked up like a mothafucka when they mention me. 
Cause you fuckin' with the realest motha fucka ever born, 
And once again it's on, 
I'm bustin' on these bitches till they gone. 
Who the hell can you get to stop me? 
I'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse. 
I keep my glock cocked 
I need it cause they're all shady. 
I finally made it 
now these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me! 
I ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back. 
I'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack. 
And I came up a long way from food stamps. 
And takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps. 
Could you blame me if they sweat me I'm gonna open fire. 
What could I do? Pull my trigga or watch my nigga die. 
I'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs. 
I'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs. 
And mothafucka, we be ballin'! 
All mothafuckin' day long, stay strong! 
We str8 ballin'.











(Reporter)
Good Evening (sirens in the background)
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles
(crowd starts chanting "Tupac")
Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac
Which, raises the question
Where are these songs coming from?
It's interesting how, the message in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now
(Crowd)
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...







A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
They say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffin weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facing
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evading the player hating tricks, while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But y'all some hoes, the game should be sewed
I'm sick of psychotic society somebody save me
Addicted to drama so even mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
I'm ducking the cop, I hit the weed as I'm clutching my glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block, what if I die tonight
[Chorus:]
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
"Tonight's the night I get in some shit"
Polishing pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
When I get to popping niggas is dropping then they done
Calling the coroner come collect the fucking corpse
He got it by killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method, whenever stepping keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets making crack sales
Picture perfection pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me my pistol posse's using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversatin' like they still here, if I die tonight
[Chorus]
Pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the heavens three-fifty-sevens to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for Thug Living when I die
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto for Thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a player
Overdose of a dick, while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whipping these simps, for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me nigga I ain't happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading murdered to death, my last breath
Take a look picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand, if I die tonight
[Chorus]
"? like a mother-fuckin' Jew throws cash"







(2Pac)	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Oooohhh, oooohhh
(2Pac)	Nuttin to lose..
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Oahhhh, oahhhahh
(2Pac)	I got nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Oh-hahhh
(2Pac)	Stuck in the game
	Me against the world baby
Verse One: 2Pac
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin
There ain't no stoppin me
Constantly movin while makin millions
Witnessin killings, leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children cause they're illin
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin, but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetary
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live?  No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Me against the world
(2Pac)	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Ooooh yeah, ooo-hooo
(2Pac)	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Me against the world
(2Pac)	Cause it's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Hey!!
(2Pac)	Me against the world
(girl)	Ooooh yeah
(2Pac)	I got nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	I got nothing to lose
Verse Two: Dramacydal
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stones, Baby Capone's, livin wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
and screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall
Everday there's mo'death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
when I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well
(girl)	Me against the world
(2Pac)	With nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Ooh yeah.. oooh-ooooh
(2Pac)	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Me against the world
(2Pac)	I got nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Oahhhohh
(2Pac)	Ha ha
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Ha-ahh, HA-AHH!
(2Pac)	With nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Me against the world, hoahhh
(2Pac)	Me against the world
	I got nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Ha-hahh (hehe) heyy!
Verse Three: 2Pac
With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest?  Through this supression
they punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches, in a position of makin a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world
(girl)	Me against the world
(2Pac)	Nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Me against the world
(2Pac)	Got me stuck in the game
	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Oahahhhh
(2Pac)	I'd be ashamed to lose
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Me against the world
Outro: 2Pac
Heh, hahahahahahah
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uhh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it
(girl)	Me against the world
Me against the world 
Me against the world







I shall not fear no man, but God
Though I walk through tha valley of death
I shed so many tears
Please God walk with me...
Back in Elementry, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
Inside mind couldn't find a place ta rest
Untill I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Yo Mo Bee main, drop that shit!
Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy
You know what time, boo-yaow
I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand youknowhatI'msayin
And uhh, throw up that finger
Ay yo yo yo throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?
Verse One:
Tell me baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if ya only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong love tell me, cause I get caught up
and the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see
the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard
I've been known to clown and Get Around, that's my word
See you walkin and you lookin good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin me
witcha attitude to match right, don't be phony
cause I hate when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin in the spotlight, I want the fame
but the industry's a lot like, a crack game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be wit you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go...
Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy 
Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go..
Give them the finger!
Ya know what baby it's like
*singing*
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care
Verse Two:
Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
in my ride and I'm all in, gettin high
I can hear the people callin, I'm passin by
Everybody knows I'm ball-in, and to God
Gotta keep myself from fall-in, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do
Gettin shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
in your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve
Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates, do you wanna fall up in heaven
Don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was...
Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy
Give em the finger!
All my homies go..
Throw your fingers up!
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like
*singing*
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care
Verse Three:
A lot of people think it's easy, to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me, in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin up the telephone, reminiscin
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin, you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin
See you later, cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was
Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy
Give em the finger
And all my homies go.. 
yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?
Throw your fingers up
Y'know? 
They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you
*singing*
Everybody, heyy, alright
Heyy, heyyyeah, heyyyayyy, ohh
(2Pac)
All my niggaz go
Uptown in the
Give em the finger!
Throw your hands up
Give em the finger!







I wanna dedicate this one to Robert 'Yummy' Sanderford
and all other lil' young niggaz that's in a rush to be gangstas
As a young nigga, I'm almost swellin in the wind
Give anythang, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang but I was hangin with the homies
tell them niggaz started slangin that they don't know me
I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
Lately I've been tryin to make a bill-ion, can you play me
with that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me
If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I
someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride
Put down the top, now we flossin
Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
Workin with a twenty sack of indo, feelin good
Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs
And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, know it's bad
but all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
as young niggaz
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known
Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin by, when daddy died
That's when my momma started gettin high
My neighborhood was full of drivebys, couldn't survive
All our homies livin short lives, I couldn't cry
Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket
let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history, it's just
Me Against the World stuck in misery; as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches avoid snitched cause they shady, back in the days
We always found the time to play,
but that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis
Every stadium that I go, when will they change?
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was, to be a young nigga
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known
I'm tellin you..
(Lady Levi)
Oh, you tink life is yours?
Life ain't na somethin you can rap with
Ooh come na ordinary game
Da game na somethin you can rap with
Me's a player you know?
I do not, play in no game
Me just, make money, dollars, everytime seen?
Verse One: 2Pac
Now how can I explain how this game laced, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four/seven
Money's my mission, just tryin to make a livin
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin they riches on skanless bail
who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass, playa-hatin but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin through my pager, know me
Don't have no homies cause they jealous, I hustle solo
Cause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas, listen
Ain't nothin poppin 'bout no work, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough 
(Game's been good to me)
Heavy in the game 
(Lady Levi)
Who da bumba claat him a come try take mine?
Oooh, me see you rushin up 
(Game's been good to me)
I throw 'im blood claat P.M. to A.M.
All, all da bumba come ya take dis ting 
for ya take dis ting for joke?
(I don't care what it did to them
The game's been good to me)
Oh! Dat's right
Verse Two: Richie Rich
Well lemme shoot some of this how heavy type of stuff..
Certain wanna stick to the game, yousea trick to the game
Waitin upon your turn, so when will you learn?
Ain't no turns given, be twistin and takin it
Puttin they sack down, then puttin they mack down
Me myself I hustle with finesse yes I'm an Oakland baller
Rule number one: check game, and fo' sho' you gon' respect game
Be yo' own, meanin buy yo' own dope
Cause that front is punk, somethin I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real; disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jackin and robbin, despisin your homie
ain't healthy, endin up dead 'fore they get wealthy
But not me though, I'm sewin somethin major
so what I reap is boss -- that's why my public status is floss
Went from a, young gangsta livin residential
to a, young gangsta workin presidential
(Game's been good to me)
(Lady Levi)
Me boy Tu-pac ALWAYS look good
You know that's true 'im look good every time
Ooh, war? Step up
(Game's been good to me)
Can yi know I'm servin up blood claat
playin yi games
Ooh, we take game, we WON 
(I don't care what it did to them
The game's been good to me)
Any by now, all, yi haffa forget fi we WON
Everytime
Verse Three: 2Pac
I'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth
Had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
Headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail, is out here doin dirt
Made my decisions do or die, been hustlin since junior high
No time for askin why, gettin high, gettin mine
Put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five sales
cause life is hell and everybody dies
What about these people I despise -- them loud talkin cowards 
shootin guns into crowds, jeapordizin lives
Shoot em right between them thugz eyes, it's time to realize
follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's tryin to make the news, people confused
Quit tryin to be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself, go with the grain
and come the riches and the girls and the fame
Heavy in the game 
(Game's been good to me)
(Lady Levi)
Boy, ya nah bitch!
Major that's true we look good everytime
when we at Beers Diamond
and Tupac drives vintage car
(Game's been good to me)
And fi dem frame dem look good, oh no?
This whole world ya call on
gonna mass on a face 
(I don't care what it did to them
The game's been good to me)
For any, section of bumba ras claat, oh!
Flush it! .. Oh!
Nobody wan come test me y'know
true dem we a drive pretty car
Wanna no part of any ting
and now you wan come drown a gun
But ya see we know, you haffa show 'im MAXIMUM respect
for when a blood claat run or when a pussy walk up
we look good everytime
Nuff dollars, DOLLARS
Y'know about dollars dem right?
But we nah talk no shit
We haffa walk de walk for we a talk, see it?
Cause action, action speak louder dan words
You know da record!
Don't blood claat ting at ALL







(2Pac)
Damn, another funeral, another motherfucker
Lord knows * 'Pac is choking on blunt smoke *
Lord knows * coughing harder *
Lord knows * one final cough *
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
I'm hopeless, they shoulda killed me as a baby
And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin crazy
Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
and if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards
I'm loosin hope, they got me stressin, can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennesey got me queasy
Don't wanna earl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block
slangin rocks with your glocks put this tape in your box
When you're runnin from the cops -- and never look back
If they could be black, then they would switch
Open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and Lord knows...
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows * coughing again *
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows * still coughing *
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me
and every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
and still a nigga stressin over death
If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd
take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly
When everyday it's another death, with every breath,
it's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
Murderin niggaz, look what it's come to
My memories bring me misery, and life is hard 
in the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breath
Got me thinkin, what do Hell got?
Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin shell-shocked
And driveby's an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin game
and Lord knows...
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows!
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
One-time! One-time!
Fuck the five-oh cause they after me
Kill me if they could, I'll never let em capture me
Done lost too many niggaz to this gangbangin
Homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin, fucked up!
I had to tell him it was alright, and that's a lie
and he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man
Hennesey make a nigga think he strong, man (heh heh)
I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down, I ain't givin up
I'm gettin lost in the weed, man, gettin high
Livin everday, like I'm gon' die (gon' die, gon' die)
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out, and if I wasn't high
probably try to blow my brains out
Lord knows...
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows!
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows.. Jesus..
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(He is listening! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows.. Lord knows.. he he.. he.. he.. heeee...)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)







You are appreciated.
When I was young me and my mama had beef
17 years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys, breakin' all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary
One day, runnin' from the police that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend mama 
You always was a black queen mama 
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed, a poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it, there's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand.
You are appreciated.
Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya.
Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin' 
I needed money of my own so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I can see you comin' home after work, late
Your in the kitchen tryin' to fix us a hot plate
Just workin' with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, your alone
Tryin' to raise 2 bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand.
You are appreciated.
Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (And dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya.
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I got to thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand.
You are appreciated.
Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady. Lady. Lady. Lady.







Keepin it real
Verse One: 2Pac
I take a shot of Henessey now I'm strong enough to face the madness
Nickel bag full of sess weed laced with hash
Phone calls from my niggaz on the, other side
Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry
A damn shame, when will we ever change
And what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain
Arguements with my Boo is true
I spend mo' time with my niggaz than I do with you
But everywhere it's the same thang, that's the game
I'll be damned if a thang changed, fuck the fame
I'll be hustling to make a mill-ion, lord knows
Ain't no love for us ghetto children, so we cold
Rag top slowin down, time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass, uhh
It ain't easy, that's my motto
Drinkin Tanqueray straight out the bottle
Everybody wanna know if I'm insane
My baby mama gotta mind full of silly games
And all the drama got me stressin like I'm hopeless, I can't cope
Me and the homies smokin roaches, cause we broke
Late night hangin out til the sunrise gettin high
Watchin the cops roll by
It ain't easy... that's right
Chorus: 2Pac
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free
(repeat 3X)
Verse Two: 2Pac
I can't sleep niggaz plottin on to kill me while I'm dreamin
Wake up sweaty and screamin, cause I can hear them suckers schemin
Probably paranoid, problem is, them punks be fantasizin
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died
I wonder why this the way it is, even now
Lookin out for these killer kids, cause they wild
Bill Clinton can you recognize a nigga representin
Doin twenty to life in San Quentin
Gettin calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nuttin nice
Yo 'Pac, do something righteous witcha life
And even thou you innocent you still a nigga, so they figure
Rather have you behind bars than triggers
But I'm hold ya down and holla Thug Life, lickin shots
Til I see my niggaz free on the block
But no it ain't easy, hahahah
Til I see my niggaz free, on the block, oh
It ain't easy
Chorus 2.75
Verse Three: 2Pac
Lately been reminiscin
bout Peppermint Schnapps in Junior High hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while D-Boys slang rocks
It's the project kid without a conscience, I'm havin dreams
of hearin screams at my concerts, me all my childhood peers
through the years tryin to stack a little green
I was only seventeen, when I started servin fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dollar
So my apoli', casue these hard times make me wanna holler
Will I live to see tommorrow, am I fallin off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of y'all
Ain't nobody down with me I'm thuggin, I can't go home
Cause muh-fuckers think I'm buggin, so now I'm in
this high powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail, what
do I do in these county blues
Gettin battered and bruised by the you know who
And these fakes get to shakin when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sittin in this, livin hell, listenin to niggaz yell
Tryin to torture em to tell, I'm gettin mail
But ain't nobody sayin much, the same old nuts
is makin bucks while these sluts is gettin fucked
They violated my probation, and it seems
I'll be goin on a long vacation, meanwhile
It ain't easy
No it ain't easy
Chorus
Chorus







(2Pac) Whassup? It's 2Pac. Can you get away?
Let me come swoop you up.
(girl) You know I got a man.
(2Pac) I know you got a man
but he ain't gon' if I take you out.
(girl) Of course he gon' mind.
(2Pac) Let me take you to lunch.
I'll have you back before he even get home;
before anybody see.
(girl) I can't. (Aww c'mon!) He ain't gon' let me.
(2Pac) Pleeeeeease...
(girl) Nah.
(2Pac) Oh aight. What's wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?
Verse One: 2Pac
Ever since I met ya I could beat depression
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't bout no suckin and touchin, just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations -- would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
But anticipation of love makin 
got you shakin when I'm standin near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate -- but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me can you get away?
Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon.. let's go.. can you get away?
Can you get away?
(girl) So much pressure in the air
(2Pac) I know, I know
(girl) And I can't get away
(2Pac) Just for a little while love
(girl) I'm not happy here
(2Pac) I know it's hard but, can you get away?
(girl) So much pressure in the air
(2Pac) Let's go man, get up outta there
.. can you get away?
(girl) And I can't get away
(2Pac) Do you love him?
(girl) I'm not happy here
(2Pac) Do you love that man?
Verse Two: 2Pac
Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
And checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony
But you was different -- I got no need to be suspicious
Cause I can tell -- my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
when he ain't lookin, now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care -- that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Can you get away?
(girl) So much pressure in the air
(2Pac) I know it is
(girl) And I can't get away
(2Pac) Yeah you can
(girl) I'm not happy here
(2Pac) You ain't happy huh ..can you get away?
(girl) So much pressure in the air
(2Pac) I know.. is he beatin on you?
(girl) And I can't get away
(2Pac) Did he punch you?
(girl) I'm not happy here
(2Pac) Throwin you around the house?
Verse Three: 2Pac
I see you remiscin and I hope you listenin
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you -- was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to the sucker
Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share
You're livin in prison and what he's givin can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passion it be yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?
(girl) So much pressure in the air
(2Pac) Can't get away.. why?
(girl) And I can't get away
(girl) I'm not happy here
(2Pac) Let me take you away
All I really know, can you get away?
(girl) So much pressure in the air
(2Pac) Man..
(girl) And I can't get away
(2Pac) Course you can get away
(girl) I'm not happy here
(2Pac) If you really wanted to get away
you could get away
Outro: 2Pac
You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
with this old half a man, yaknowhatI'msayin?

YaknowhatI'msayin? You need to be on first class
Need to be goin to Hawaii, seein the world
Seein what this world got to offer you
Not goin to, yaknowhatI'msayin?
The emergency room, gettin stitches
cause this nigga done got jealous
Don't cry, it's all good
(girl) Can you take me from here?
(2Pac) Shake that man, get away
(girl) Can you take me from here?
I'ahhhhhm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it's so much pressure now
And I neeeeed to get awayyyheyyyeahhh







Here we go; we gonna send this one out to the old school
All these motherfuckers in the Bronx, and Brooklyn, and Staten Island
Queens, and all the motherfuckers that laid it down, the foundation
Ya kno what I'msayin? Nuttin but love for the old school
That's who we gon' do this one for, ya feel me?
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Nothin like the old school/ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
I remember Mr. Magic, FLASH, Grandmaster Caz
LL raisin' hell but, that didn't last
Eric B. & Rakim was, the shit to me
I flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D
And Red Alert was puttin' in work, with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill gettin ill, when shit was real
Went out to steal, remember Raw, with Daddy Kane
When De La Soul was puttin' potholes in the game
I can't explain how it was, Whodini
Had me puffin on that buddha gettin buzzed, cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggi don't stop, sippin on that Private Stock
Through my speaker Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte
Listen to Treach, KRS to get me through the night
With T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic
Remember Push It was the bomb shit, nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Heheheh, it ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Yeaheheh, it ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Heheh... I had, Shell Toes, and BVD's
A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets
I'm playin skelly, ring to leavey, or catch a kiss
Before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch, I remember
Way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
I'm on the train headin uptown, freestylin'
With some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin'
'Cause the hoochies was starin, thinkin, Why them niggas swearin'?
I'm wonderin if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, pump the hoochies on the wall
Or takin' leaks on the steps, stinkin up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin to stay away from Riker's Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights, tryin to keep it true
Out on the roof sippin 90 proof, ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Heheheyah, that's right, it ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Ain't nuttin like the old school
What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Hahah... remember poppin and lockin to Kurtis Blow, the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Hoe back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick was spittin La Di Da Di
Gamin the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties, I remem-ber
Breakdancin to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the TV, about to hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful don't let the transit cops see me
It ain't nuttin like the old school
(Grand Puba sample repeats every bar to end)
It ain't nuttin like the old school
Hahahah, it ain't nuttin like the old school
Hey, heheaha, on the real though, ain't nuttin like the old school
Remember seein Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfuckin party?
Member how fuckers used to go, Is Brooklyn in the house?
And motherfuckers would lose they GOD DAMN MIND
That's the old school to me; that's what I'm sayin (Su-per, Sperm)
I remember goin places that motherfuckers was scared to say
They was from anywhere but Brooklyn; that shit was the bomb
Back in the motherfuckin old school nigga
Remember skelly nigga? Knockin niggaz out the box, poppin boxes?
Member stickball? Member niggaz to run that shit like that?
Member the block members screamin up at your mom from the window?
(LL Cool J is hard as HELL...)
The ice cream truck, member all the mother...
Member the italian icey's yo?
Yo remember the italian icey's the spanish niggaz comin down
With the coconut icey's and shit?
I came through the door, said it before
That was the SHIT







(2Pac)
Haha, what you say?
Who you callin rapist? Ain't that a bitch
You devils, are so two faceted
Wanna see me locked in chains, dropped in shame
and gettin stalked by these crooked cops a-gain
Fuckin with the young black male, tryin to stack bail
and umm, stay away from the packed jails
I told the judge I'm in danger
and that's why I had that fo'-five with one in the chamber
Fuck the world!
Chorus: 2Pac
(They tryin to say that I don't care)
I woke up screamin, Fuck the world!
(They tryin to say that I don't care)
Just woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They tryin to say that I don't care)
Uhh, I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They're tryin to say that I don't care)
Just got up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(2Pac)
When I was comin up rough that wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin, threats to me, comin from my enemies
And, in they dreams it's, Hell where they sendin me
Have I, lost control or just another soul
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sippin on yak as I sit back (YES!) life as a big mack
Brothers come up and say, You did that? (uhh, uhh, uhh)
Never take yo' eyes off the prize, and even if you gettin high
don't ever hesitate to try
Cause you can fall off or stay ballin, niggaz we all in
And them my motherfuckers callin (ohh, ohh, ohh)
Fuck the world!
Chorus: 2Pac
(They tryin to say that I don't care)
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They tryin to say that I don't care)
Just woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They tryin to say that I don't care)
I got up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They tryin to say that I don't care)
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They tryin to say that I don't care)
(2Pac)
Man, fuck the world..
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
cause I'm sittin here sippin on Guinness
Weighin 165, and these tricks should die
for bein jealous of a brother when he rides
I can see it in yo' eyes, you wanna see a young playa fallin
They hate to see a nigga ballin
Some of you suckers is rottin, plottin on what I got
And then you wonder why I shot him (boo-ya!)
Stop givin game for free, you wanna hang with me
like being a thug is the thang to be?
But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're black, you better stay strapped
Nigga, fuck the world!
Chorus: 2Pac
(They tryin to say that I don't care)
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They try to say that I don't care)
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They tryin to say that I don't care)
Got up and screamed, Fuck the world!
Haha, fuck the world! Fuck it
I hear my niggaz screamin fuck the world!
(2Pac)
They wanna know if I claim the click, that I'm hangin with
and if I'm down with this bangin shit
Well homie I don't give a fuck if you Blood or Cuz
Long as ya got love for thugs
But don't try to test me out, stall that
Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped
I been through, Hell and back, and if I, fell black
then it's, back to the corner where we sell crack
Some of you niggaz is bustas; you runnin 'round 
with these tramp=ass bitches, don't trust her
But don't cry, this world ain't prepared for us
A straight thug motherfucker who ain't scared to bust
Fuck the world!
Chorus: 2Pac 
(They tryin to say that I don't care)
I woke up and screamed, Fuck the world!
(They're tryin to say that I don't care)
I woke up screamin, Fuck the world! (Uhh!)
(They tryin to say that I don't care)
I woke up screamin, Fuck the world!
(Yeah what's goin on y'all?)
(Uhh, uhh, uhh..) Fuck the world!
(I don't care.. I don't care, I don't care!)







Child: Why you by the window?, what's wrong daddy?
Mother: I know what's wrong with that crazy motherfucker
He's just stand by the goddamn window
with that fuckin' AK all day
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't,
you don't do a goddamn thing
I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the corner, any day
Trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I think about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress,
I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self,
but I see death around the corner
Chorus
(When we were kids, belonging felt good)
I see death around the corner
(But having respect, that feels even better)
I see death around the corner
(When we were kids, belonging felt good)
I see death around the corner
(But having respect, that feels even better)
I see death around the corner,
the pressure's getting to me
I no longer trust my homies,
them phonies tried to do me
Smoking too much weed,
got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest,
under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived,
straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas
that was buggin'
My homie told me once,
don't you trust them other suckers
They fought like they your homies
but they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who cares
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
I got homies in my head
who done passed away screamin', please
Young nigga, make Gs
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless,
I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner
Chorus
I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household,
And drinking liquor til' you out cold
And tho' I'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow
Bustin' on them niggas till they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless,
them bitches will start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you til you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G
And gettin' high was a way of gettin' free
I see death around the corner
Chorus
This is for all the real mothafuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die
(Tupac)
That's right nigga you gotta get your papers in this motherfucker
I ain't mad at ya at all (damn)
Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up RahRah?
(RahRah) Nigga, is you stupid, I wanna be a motherfuckin Outlaw
(Tupac) That's right nigga, hahaha.. housin these hoes, you feel me?
(RahRah) Aight, knowhatI'msayin?
(Tupac) You got to do that shit, keepin it real nigga or what?
(RahRah) Keepin it real!
(Tupac) How old are you nigga?
(RahRah) I'm eleven
(Tupac)
Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
preoccupied with homicide, tryin to survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require many closed caskets
Who can you blame? It's insane what we dare do
Witnessin evil that these men do, bitches sin too
In fact they be the reasons niggaz get to bleedin
For the fuckin fire when I leave em, you shoulda seen em
Hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) and foes disposed of
and snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a
* Chorus *
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)
(Tupac)
Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin well
when I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin pictures of these bastards
Excersisin, visualizin, everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggaz in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? and if we fail?
High speeds, and thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh
Drivebys and niggaz die, murder without a motive 
by making motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryin to hover over niggaz till we drop
Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a liar
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
"Motherfuckers is crooked," is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a
* Chorus *
(Dramacydal)
Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggaz lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggaz bodies put to rest
So I just.. swallow my Beck's and holla, "Fuck em!"
And if I'm next.. just let a nigga step with somethin
I ain't fearin nuttin
Young and thuggin, prepared for bustin if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggaz can't get the best of me
(hold me down) Definitely no need for askin
(now we mashin) Top speed (smokin weed) blastin (biotch!)
Cause when I bust em they gonna shiver, the killer squad soldiers
Got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin?
Talkin bout prayin -- they need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggaz sprayin up my block, tryin to take my wealth
* Chorus 2X *
(Tupac)
Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge
Punk police, niggaz run the streets
Hahah, it ain't nuttin but muuuuzik
Shit's changed
1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin REAL strange
The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin dead in the streets
These punk police is crooked as me
but all I see is motherfuckers actin less than G's
Stop bein a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel
Cause you know these streets is real deal
Muh'fuckers wanna see me in my casket
Jealous, motherfuckin bastards
I never die, thug niggaz multiply
Cause after me is Thug Life baby
Then the young thugs
Then the youngest thug of all my nigga RahRah











(2Pac *singing in background* 2X)
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G
(Let's get ready to ruuumbllle!!)
(2Pac *speaking over background*)
Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
(2Pac *singing in background starts to overlap/repeat*)
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah  
Got the police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah..
(2Pac *speaking over background*)
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah!
My ambitions as a ridah!
(2Pac)
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressin the mad public
My attitude was, Fuck it, cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uhh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, Go to the tele hoe
You put what money in a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smokin bomb-ass weed feelin crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin and prayers, to breakin motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishin
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressin (boo-yaa!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's manditory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches gettin suspicious
Started plottin and plannin on schemes, to come and trick us
But Thug niggaz be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggaz is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uhh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hopin you listen I catch you payin attention 
To my amibitions as a ridah
Chorus: 2Pac
(singing) I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(singing) My ambitions as a ridah
(singing) Got the police bustin at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G 
(Tupac)
(I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah)
Peep it.. it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward mutherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screamin as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me (that's all you niggaz got?) witness my steel
Spittin at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they catchin me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinkin thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah
Chorus
(Tupac)
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops cause I know they comin for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
Niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I caught the perfect way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
Gettin much mail in jail, niggaz tellin me to kill it
Knowin when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggaz that played me, 
And all the cowards that was down widdit
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hopin you listenin, catch you payin attention 
To my ambitions as a ridah
Chorus 2.5X







(2Pac) Ahh yeah
(Down) Yeauhh!
(2Pac) It's all about you, one time!
(Down) I'ma say it's all about you baby, yeah
(2Pac) Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you

(Down) Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin though, hah! Yeauhh
(2Pac)
You probably crooked as the last trick; want it light
But how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin with the wrong one, uh!
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin for some love
In every club, I see you starin like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin
Guess it's true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit
Fantansies of us sweatin, can I hit it? (Hahaha)
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin Boo, is this is all about you
(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(Yeah nigga, ha ha ha ha!)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(2Pac)
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out
With the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggaz
Cause we comin from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep though, weed smoke's into the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin through..
It's all about you.. hahaha, yeah nigga!
It's all about you!
(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(Outlawz)
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe
You think it's all about you? Well Boo
I gets Down like Dru and my nasty new niggaz, too
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me
Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(Snoop Doggy Dogg *speaking over last two lines*)
I'm tellin ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean.. god damn, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'm sittin back, watchin Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch, who was in, my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin out my homeboy Tupac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, yaknahmsayin?
And then yaknahmsayin what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in, the homeboy Warren G video!
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same hoe
Don't get mad, I'm only bein real
Yeah







(2Pac) Hey Nate you know you got to focus on this motherfucker
We's gonna talk about these scandalous hoes
(Nate) I can talk about scandalous bitches
(2Pac) Oh I know you can!
I know you that's why we gonna do it
Daz on the beat
Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin around with the piano nigga
Just drop that shit like uhh, this here
(2Pac)
I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed cause baby that shit was so phony
It's not for me, you see no lovin from my closest homies
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house 
and can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggaz, playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, Never breathing again
It's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbin ass, triiick
Used to watch you money grabbin, who you baggin beeyitch?
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin scandalous
Chorus: Nate Dogg
Scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
(2Pac)
How's it hangin? Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin
I've been stressin in this ghetto game, tryin to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin
This bitch'll have ya wakin up with all your cash missin
I'm askin, as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin at a bitch who specialize in tellin lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
Verse One: Daz
You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I gets deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those 
Who can withstand, the mo' power I gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard, I'm faced witha mirage
breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies...
Verse Two: Tupac
So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
We must be based on nothin better than communication
Known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shakin
I'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
Don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitches planned it
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
but thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm acvtivatin your soul
You know, the way the games gettin sold
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme I wrote
Takin off my coat, clearing my throat
Chorus: Method Man
I got my mind made up, come on... (come on)
get in get in too (get on it)
let it ride (get wit it) tonight's tha night
I got my mind made up, come on...
get in get in too
let it ride... tonight's tha night
Verse Three: Kurupt
Well I comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fuckin sac won't collapse
Cause nowaday's, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electryfing like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's tha fuckin bom-bay
Ya got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on ya mind
As the deadly vibes spread through ya head like Sam Time
There's no escape, nah I ain't blastin
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
Opposed to laughin, raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
Why is that?  Cuz smilin faces decieve
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
Ya whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out tha cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
Ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat
Verse Four: Method Man
Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
like Hitler, stickin up Jews wit german lugers
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch tha dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket -- blaooow!!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggaz best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfuckin mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast
Verse Five: Redman
Aiyyo, lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on ya whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
to get the fresh package of bless, tha dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
Since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Coly 
And I'm out for nine nickel (INS tha rebel)
(West, list this, this, this...)







How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it, yeah? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how U want it
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk, am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic
'Cause I'm some what psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' till the show is over, 'cause I'mma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these
(Snoop) Up out of there
(Tupac) *chuckles*
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
(Snoop) Pump that up G
(Tupac) Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party-

The same motherfuckin place at the same 
-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party-
(Tupac)motherfuckin time, hahahahah
Y'all niggaz about to feel this 
-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party-
(Tupac) Break out the champagne glasses and the 
Motherfuckin condoms Have one on us aight? 
-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party-
(2Pac)
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fuckin homey
Youse a cold ass nigga on them hogs
(Snoop)
Sho nuff, I keep my hand on my gun, 
Cuz they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free Tupac, is all that's on a niggaz mind
But at the same time it seem they tryin to take mine
So I'ma get smart, and get defensive and shit
And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit
(2Pac)
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin cases (mmm)
Bitches get ready for the throwdown, 
The shit's about to go down
Uhh, me and Snoop about to clown
I'm Losin My Religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin
Niggaz be actin like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got, nuthin but love, for my niggaz livin lavish
(Snoop)
I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I, think I got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal
Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker
(2Pac)
Now follow as we riiiiide
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous
Niggaz been dyin for years, so how could they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin these, motherfuckin G's
If ya got it better flaunt it, another warrant
2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted
Chorus:
-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party-
-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party-
(Tupac) Nuthin but a gangsta party... Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
-Nuthin but a gangsta party-

-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party-
(Tupac) Nuthin but a gangsta party it ain't nuthin but a
Motherfuckin gangsta party 
-Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party-
(2Pac)
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me
I bust and flea, these niggaz must be crazy what??
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the Thugs
(hahah right) You thought it was but it wasn't, now dissapear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
(Snoop)
It's like cuz, blood, gangbangin
Everybody in the party doin dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard til ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids
(2Pac)
They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floatin in the black Benz, tryin to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill, on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted
Chorus (w/ variations to end)







Intro: 2Pac
Hey DeVante
Nigga, don'tcha know we're gonna sow up every bitch in the country
Me and you, up in the same motherfuckin room
On the same level
This shit here, hahahaha
Please, no more pain
That's right nigga
Hey drop that shit boy
Verse One: 2Pac
My adversaries cry like hoes fully eradicate my foes
My lyrics explode on contact, gamin you hoes
Who else but Mama's only son, fuck the phony niggaz I'm the one
Say my name, watch bitches come, now fire
when ready, stay watchin now figure, increase speed
Make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggaz that you run with, be on some dumb shit
Trick on the hoes, I ain't the one bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick 
Have every single bitch that came witchu, on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin you stupid bitches, vicious telekenesis
Am I reachin your brain? Nigga how can I explain?
How vicious this Thug motherfucker came
When I die, I wanna be a livin legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin game, with no more pain
Chorus: 
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (repeat 4X)
Verse Two: 2Pac
Line up my adversaries, blast on sight, and fuck your boyfriend
Bitch, I want some ass tonight, you know my steelo
Alize and Cristal, weed sure you heard of all the freaky shit they say about me, huh
Plus all you busters is jealous, pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggaz to open fire, I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the cops come runnin, my glock's spittin rounds
niggaz fallin down clutchin they stomach
It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggaz on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggaz don't die
Can ya hear me? Laced with this game, I know you fear me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a solider with a brain to teach your whole nation
And feelin no more pain
Chorus 4X
Verse Three: 2Pac
Bury me that's what they all say, it's time to make a killin
Sure to make a million with DeVante
Bitch I know you want me, what your mouth say? Now, watch your eyes
You don't wanna get with me, that's a lie
I got my hands on your hips, no time to bullshit
Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggaz from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin it ain't nothin we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker, cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, baptised the public
Now you hard thugs, nigga don't you love it
It's similar to multiple gunshots, retaliation is a must
Wasn't too sure what you facin so watch the guns bust
You niggaz'll bleed, fuckin with me you'll be deceased
Never restin in peace nigga, with no more pain
Chorus 8X
(Tupac talking over the chorus)
Hahahahaha, yeah nigga, yeah! Hahahaha
No more pain
It's just like that nigga, like that yeah

Motherfuckers can't handle that shit
Much too much for these bitches
No more pain
Feel me nigga? Feel me?
How you figure you can fuck with me?
Fully automatic type shit
No more pain
Coward ass niggaz, cowards
Come put your mouth on this pistol nigga
Come put your mouth on the pistol, no more pain
Close your eyes nigga, do it

Westsiiiiiide! Death to everybody that ain't down with me

Put your mouth on the pistol!
Hahahaha, yeah nigga no more pain
Prison ain't changed me nigga, it made me worse

Hey DeVante I'm givin these motherfuckers choices

This year you motherfuckers gonna be dust
Thug Life nigga Westsiiiiide!







Ahh, Suge what I tell you nigga,

cause its gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik gonna show you niggas what it's like on this side

Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real mutha-fuckas 
and there's gonna be some pussys
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussys are gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize cause the ride get tricky
See you got some niggas on your side
That say they're your friends 
But in real life they your enemies
And then you got some mutha-fuckas that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See the enemies will say they true
But in real life those niggas will be the snitches

Y'all got ta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with
Cause the shit get wild y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, Baby
Keep your mind on your riches
9-1-1 its a emergency cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar
cowards die
My mama told me When I was to see
Just a vicious mutha fucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver 
when I deliver
Criminal lyrics 
from a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Mackaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, thats what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinitely Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches 
like a south paw you get let
And every breath I breathe untill the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Internally I live in sin 
untill the moment that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men
(Chorus)
The Heartz of Men
My lyrical verse with so much pain 
that to some niggas it hurts 
My guns bust
And if you ain't one of us 
it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll 
in fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw 
and five-o, get your lights on, fight long 
tonights gonna be a fuckin' fight 
so we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a 'G' to this 'til the day I'm gone that's regardless
Drive-by, niggas bow down
thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up 
first nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villian if ya let me 
I'll Muthafuck ya 
if ya do upset me 
tell the cops to come and get me
rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no muthafuckin' friends nigga
Look inside the heartz of men
(Chorus)
In The Heartz of Men
In The Heartz of Men
To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear 
my pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year 
like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a Don
If niggas is having problems 
smoke'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back, 
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing 
scar'd up 
but still flowing
energized and still going
Uhh, can it be fate 
that makes a sick muthafucka break
On these jealous ass coward cuz they evil and fake
Chorus:
How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz?
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
It'd be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas, we tha last ones left
but life goes on.....
How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz?
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
It'd be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas, we tha last ones left
but life goes on.....
Verse One:
As I bail through tha empty halls
breath stinkin' in my draws
ring, ring, ring
quiet y'all
incoming call
plus this my homie from high school
he's getting bye
It's time to bury another brotha nobody cry
life as a baller
alchol and booty calls
we usta do them as adolecents
do you recall?
raised as G's
loc'ed out and blazed the weed
get on tha roof
let's get smoked out
and blaze with me
2 in tha morning
and we still high assed out
screamin' 'thug till I die'
before I passed out
but now that your gone
I'm in the zone
thinkin'
'I don't wanna die all alone'
but now ya gone
and all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death
i'm drinkin' Hennessy
while tryin' ta make it last
I drank a 5th for that ass
when you passed....
cause life goes on
Chorus
Verse Two:
Yeah nigga
I got tha word as hell
blew trial and tha judge gave you
25 with an L
time to prepare to do fed time
won't see parole
imagine life as a convict
that's getten' old
plus with tha drama
we're lookin out for your babies mama
taken risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from beatin on her...
life in tha hood...
is all good for nobody
remember gamin' on dumb hotties at your party
Me and you
No true a two
while scheming on hits
and gettin tricks
that maybe we can slide into
but now you burried
rest nigga
cause I ain't worried
eyes blurry
sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
tho' memories fade
I got your name tated on my arm
so we both ball 'til my dying days
before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace
Thug till I die
Chorus
Verse Three:
Bury me smilin'
with G's in my pocket
have a party at my funeral
let every rapper rock it
let tha hoes that I usta know
from way before
kiss me from my head to my toe
give me a paper and a pen
so I can write about my life of sin
a couple bottles of Gin
in case I don't get in
tell all my people i'm a Ridah
nobody cries when we die
we outlaws
let me ride
until I get free
I live my life in tha fast lane
got police chasen' me
to my niggas from old blocks 
from old crews
niggas that guided me through 
back in tha old school
pour out some liquor
have a toast for tha homies
see we both gotta die
but ya chose to go before me
and brothas miss ya while your gone
you left your nigga on his own
how long we mourn
life goes on...
(Chorus repeats to end)
(Spoken over repeating chorus:)
Life goes on homie

Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel ya nigga, trust me

You know what I mean

life goes on....
and we up out this bitch
hey Kato, Mental
y'all niggas make sure it's popin' when we get up there

(Intro: 2Pac)
Only God can judge me, is that right?
(synth voice) Only God can judge me now
Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business
(Verse One: 2Pac)
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin time
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin tell me what's the use of tryin
I've been trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin all the killin here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin for
Everybody's droppin got me knockin on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me
(Chorus: 2Pac)
(synth voice) Only God can judge me
That's right baby, yeah baby
(synth voice) Only God
Hahahahahahahaha
(synth + Pac) Only God can judge me, only God can judge
(synth cont.) me, only God
Only God can judge me
(synth + Pac) Only God can judge me
And only God can
(synth voice) Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
(synth + Pac) Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
(synth voice) Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
(synth voice) Only God can judge me now
(heart monitor: long beep)
Flatline!
(Verse Two: 2Pac)
I hear the doctor standing over me (heart monitor: beeping slowly)
screamin I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes layin here naked
Still I, can't breathe, somethings evil in my IV
Cause everytime I breathe, I think they killin me (beeping sound stops)
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantansies
I wake up strangled in, dangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
Cause even Thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin through the cemetary talkin to the, dirt
I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, "Black Power"
is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin round strapped
Mista, Po-lice, please try to see that there's
a million motherfuckers stressin just like me
Only God can judge me
(Chorus w/ variations)
(Interlude: 2Pac)
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
(That's for real)
and I don't see why everybody feel as though
that they gotta tell me how to live my life
(You know?)
Let me live baby, let me live
(Verse Three: Rappin 4-Tay, Tupac)
Pac I feel ya, keep servin it on the rilla
For instance say a playa hatin mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want em
After talkin behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin them niggaz, "You can fade him," punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
to get your safe, knowin you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember Tupac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin bullets representin the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin sellin lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know ya'll in disguise
Guess you figure you know me cause I'm a Thug
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz
Been livin lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me
(Chorus w/ variations)
(4Tay) Only God main
(2Pac) That right?
(4Tay) That's real
(2Pac) Hahahahahaha
(4Tay) Fuck everybody else, yaknowhatI'msayin?
(2Pac) Man, look here man
My only fear of death is comin back to this bitch reincarnated
That's for the homey mental
We up out
(Chorus w/out 2Pac continues to fade)







A military mind nigga
A military mind mean money
A criminal grind nigga
A criminal grind mean hustle
You know
We tradin war stories
We outlaws on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise
Look in my eyes. (2x)
Now can your mind picture
A thug nigga drinkin hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin up to god quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a
Hair trigga Semi-Automatic Mac-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry
But suckers is born everyday and fear of man grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries
A legend in my own rhymes
So niggas wishful when they mention
Makaveli was my tutor and Donald Goines
My father figure
Mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Henceforth
We thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of niggas strapped sippin on 'nac(Cognac)
In the back, my AR 15
Thuggin till I die
These streets got me cravin thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin
Fat as that ass that honeys' shakin
Repeat chorus 2X
I must stay thuggin and shit
They call it overthuggin and shit
But I was just a younger nigga gettin older and lovin this shit
But what was I doin in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin termination in the worst
But I figured to play the war
To watch all these playa hatin niggas position
For I could see em all
Made it up out of there
Lucky to be here
to tell you, but it'll never be a repeat
People I'm tryin to tell you
Now picture the scenery
I'm thugged out smokin greenery
Considered a BG(baby gangsta) but I'm offering
This game something deeper
My eyes only see these
That's why I'm definately bugged out
Learned to know how
Well to do now
By 18, turned out
And why I do it?
The ridin and smokin, collidin with foes in the first place
that shouldn't have fucked with us in the first place
Got real OG's(original gangsta) droppin game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no fun
California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rocking
We keep it rocking
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb-ass hemp beat
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean, mean, money-making machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-I-A
California 
 knows how to party 
California 
 knows how to party 
In the city of LA 
In the city of good old Watts 
In the city, city of Compton 
We keep it rocking 
We keep it rocking
My niggas say, come on
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali 
Shake it, shake it, baby 
Shake it, shake it, baby, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene I'm hearing hoochies screamin'
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player, where cowards die
And it's all war
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally to live and die
In LA we wearing Chucks, not Ballies 
Dressed in locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution; we collide with other crews
Famous 'cause we program worldwide
Let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know The Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-Town
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love
California 
 knows how to party
Really knows how to
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A. 
In the city of good old Watts 
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rocking
We keep it rocking
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali 
Shake it, shake it, baby 
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, mama 
Shake it Cali

Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento, where you at? Yeah
Throw it up, y'all, throw it up, throw it up, I can't see you

Cause I ain't mad at cha
Verse One: 2Pac
Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still roll
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the tip, sayin how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin, I hope your wife know
she got a playa for life, and that's no bullshitin
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd BOMB
on the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that'd
go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, cause I'm just laughin at cha
You tryin hard to maintain, then go head
cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at cha)
Chorus: Danny Boy
I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha
Verse Two: 2Pac
We used to be like distant cousins, fightin, playin dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin, knowin, that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin blitzed and I reminsce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin n grindin wasn't nothin on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we seperated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin busters on they backs
in my cell, thinkin, "Hell, I know one day I'll be back"
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin at cha
Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha
Chorus: Danny Boy
I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: A true down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha)
Verse Three: 2Pac
Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin now
Bitches be callin to get it, hookers keep fallin down
He went from nuttin to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the Luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin so high off that bomb hopin we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin at cha
You niggaz just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha
Chorus: Danny Boy
Iiiiiiiii,
I ain't, mad at cha (2Pac: and I ain't mad at cha)
Iiiiiiiii ain't mad (2Pac: hell nah I ain't mad at cha) at cha
I ain't, mad at cha (2Pac: and I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad at cha (2Pac: I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad at cha, noooo
I ain't mad at chaaaaahhhhhhhhmm

That's the intro.
Shook when ya rush me.
Walked up and touched me.
Why? Do you want to fuck me?
Just cuz I'm paid in the worst way? True.
Lookin kind a good in your birthday suit.

Watch me while you lick your lips, shake your hips.
Goddamn, I love that shit.
Yo, let's stop fakin and be real now.
I got a room and a hard on. Still down?
Met ya standin at a bar full of black dudes.

Boss playa when I ride out, that's right.

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready.

How long will it take to break you off?
(Repeat once more)
Oh shit, baby is a dime piece.
Wanted this fine seat.
Personally rushed (???)
If I see ya right.
Now she can get me hard
Didn't wanna talk to me, till she see my car.
Never had sex with a rich rap star
Till I got her in the back of my homeboy's car.
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches.
Let me hear you say:
What'z your phone number?
Are you alone?
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone.
Time for your girlfriend to take you home.
I had fun,
But baby, gotta leave me alone.
Picture in my rhyme.
Take time to rewind these (???) words I say.
If you open your mind,
Bet in a minute you'll find it's time.
Let the Outlaws play.
What'z ya phone number.

Intro: George Clinton
The blind stares
of a million pairs of eyes
lookin' hard but won't realize
that they will never see
the P
(You must be goin' blind)
Verse One: 2Pac
give me my money in stacks
and lace my bitches with 9 figures
real niggas fingers on nickle plated 9 triggas
Must see my enemies defeated
i'm cashin'
while they coughed up and weeded
open fire
now them niggas bleedin'
see me in flesh
and test
and get your chest blown
straight out tha west, don't get blown
my adversaries cry like ho's
open and shut like doors
Say he wanna be
Shorties gonna be a Thug
Said he wanna be
One day he's gonna be
Said he's wanna be
Shorties gonna be's a Thug
Said he's gonna be
One day he gonna be
Say he wanna be
Shorties gonna be a Thug
Said he gonna be
One day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be
Shorties gonna be a Thug
Verse One: 
He was a nice middle class nigga
But nobody knew the evil he'd do When he got a little bigger
Get off the final blaze 
While puffing on a Newport
Plottin' on a another way to catch a case
Was only sixteen, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas 
But you the only one who ain't telling
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me its a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, 'n break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commencing to money makin' tactics
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My fingers on the trigga, Tell the lord
To make way for another straight Thug Nigga
I'm sitting getting buzzed, looking for some luv
From the homies, cuz shorty wanna be a Thug
Chorus
Verse Two: 
Straight from the Hall to the Penn
Adolescent nigga scaling weight and standing Six feet Ten
He carried weight like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on some playa haters 
If the mutha fuckas act tuff
Then thats when the lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast pull the trigga
Could take the life of a young nigga guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the niggas all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Released with this game 'til its a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear and it ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm trying to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark getting buzzed, looking for some love
Out with the homies, cuz shorty wanna be a Thug
Chorus
Outro: 
Shorty gonna be a thug
You little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas
Gotta stay sharp nigga, play your part
You got plenty of time (you bad mutha fuckas)
You only get three mistakes, then thats life, big baby (niggas craaazy)
Watch the signs
Damn, you ain't but sixteen nigga?
Sixteen?!?!
That's a bad muthafucker







(Niggas out there jelous cuz we be bailin' with Death Row
They try to playa hate

Then you wonda why these motherfuckerz call u namez?
Still lookin' for a way out, and that'z OK

Keep ya mind on ya money, enroll in school
And as the years pass by, u can show them fools
But u ain't tryna hear me 'cause you're stuck
You're headin' for the bathroom, 'bout 2 get tossed up
Still lookin' 4 a rich man, u dug a ditch,

I love u like a sista but u need 2 switch
And that'z why they call u bitch. I betcha...
(w/"Wonder why they call you a bitch?" in background)

Talkin' 2 some nigga 'bout his car
Outlaw Immortalz
Bow down to somethin greater than yourself trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know
You watchin but you ain't seein what lies before you, beatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings
blessed with the gift to speak, the power to reach
each nigga on every street
May the Heavenly Father look down and be proud
of what transpired since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit
Just me and my dogs livin like hogs
Outlaw Immortalz
What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true
(Tupac)
Hahahahahaha
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
I pull revenge on bitch niggaz that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga bellt
Bust him to see if he bleed, he shoulda never fucked around
with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggaz run, best be prepared
for the Outlawz, here we come
(Hussein Fatal)
They call me Hussein fatal, it's a two game table
I'm robbin ya niggaz cradle wit a knife in your navel
Rap-related criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin Desert Eagle
Till the end, I'm tellin all friends and enemies
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these
Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggaz bleed, I see Mo
(Kastro)
I be shinin like white diamonds and crystal, glistenin holdin pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials
Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'ma last yo past all these Glass Joes
and assholes who claim, like they be runnin thangs
I be gunnin those same niggaz runnin late, to their fate
(Napoleon)
My alias is motherfuckin Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
robbin again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin
But the shit ain't nothin, and I got no time for no bluffin
befo' a nigga finish with puttin in work I betta end up with somethin
I think these niggaz got the game fucked up
If they don't believe, that a young nigga like me, would bust (Boo-Yaa!)
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin cases, fuck probation
is what I'm screamin when these money hungry cops be chasin
Chorus: Tupac
Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
on these playa hatin bitches, ask me why - when we ride!
Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
on these playa hatin bitches, ask me why - when we ride!
(Mussolini)
It's the imperial serial killer, alias Mussolini
Mentally unstable, G status, so you can't see me
Drug warlord, riding Concorde jets
Rag Vette's, shakin bitches and snitches and trippin on sets
Ingle-Watts banger, keepin one in the chamber
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurkin for kin, no end to revenge
Fuck any, my alias Mussolini
(Idi Amin)
They call me Idi, from the side of seedy
Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin up on these niggaz easy
It ain't nuttin, cause if they wantin somethin, so I'ma commence
to dumpin stomp down and struck up while my beat is bumpin, Thuggin
to my fuckin last nut, with lil Pole and Kastro
Who you thought was on that asshole, don't ask though
Outlaw Immortalz doin this dit-nirt on the sli-zow
Ain't no chance to hide when we ride
(Khadafi)
My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she drop me
Severely addicted to livin like a fuckin felon
while beefin with rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin
Since a short I been livin life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin like a giant, and I ain't lyin
It's like it's me against myself with all these
backstabbin snakes grabbin at my fuckin wealth
(Mo Khomani)
Mo Khomani goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cal. caps, with the murderous stacks
that increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make em feel a nigga when I'm mashin
Now I'm surpassin any assassin
Chorus 2X
(Tupac)
Hahahaha, Outlaw Immortalz baby

Multiple gunshots (fades)







Intro: 2Pac
Aight, new drink
one part Alize one part Cristal
Thugs Passion baby
y'all know what time it is
This drink is Guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
now if ya with me
Pour a glass and drink with a nigga
(Pac)
Clear enough for ya?
Why you niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Cold bustas!
Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling!
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federals wanna see me dead - niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands is swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'
Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Pictue me rollin
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?
(Syke)
I got ki's coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug breded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start bang banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin!
(CPO)
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some balding-ass niggas and they slipping in my spot
And, uh, diggin the plots (so what?)
Checking in the park, 'Pac
(Pac)
We caught em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflicting getting street sales!
(CPO)
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm as cool as a motherfucker: I'mma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Boss Hog and this 'Pac nigga: picture us rollin
(Pac)
Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there

Number one on my list: Clinton Correctional Facilities
All you bitch ass C.O.'s

Intro: 2Pac 
Ay what time is it nigga? (I don't know)
Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here (hell yeah)
Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Hey call up Kurupt, call Daz room (hey there bitch, where Suge at nigga?)
Call Suge, call all the niggaz tell em to meet me downstairs
(Where K and them niggaz at man?)
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around
(Ay y'all seen my shoes?)
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggaz drivin or y'all flyin back, whassup?
(Kurupt: Man, I'm rollin man, fuck that shit)
Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
(Fuck that, I lost some money nigga)
Aw nigga, damn
Verse One: 2Pac
Now I'm up early in the mornin breath stinkin as I'm yawnin
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy, Alize and Hennessee
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scence
Too busy trying to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time
Chorus: 2Pac
We gotta go (2X)
Gotta go, gotta go
Yeah baby, hahaha, it's check it out time
We gotta go (4X)
Gotta go nigga, gotta go (y'all know what time it is)
Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man call that valet motherfucker
Tell him to get a nigga shoe, cause we out this motherfucker
Verse Two: Kurupt
They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantansies came true, with Janet on, I'm in a Escapade
But did it all end too soon
All the homies runnin through the halls room to room, so I assume
Since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's Trump tight, so I find time to recline
Sneak into your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds 
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night, I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out 
cause there's someone else who deserves my atttention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause busting bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time
Chorus: Kurupt
We gotta go (8X)
Aiyyo man 'Pac ay where the where the fuck is Daz at man?
This nigga locked up or somethin
The only one not to leave
Yo man it's check out time, it's time to get out this mother
You seem them bitches?
We out man, fuck that shit
Yo Rece! Yo nigga whassup?
Verse Three: Syke
Hey I'm livin the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin but I'm checkin out later
My behaviour is crazy, from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin your thoughts, cause I'm livin Fed
Heard what I said? Passion is crashin the room 
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin out, you're yellin out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream, and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight, for 'Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time
Chorus: Syke
We gotta go (8X)
Ay, it's check out time
Ay 'Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin, where my shoes go nigga?
Where my motherfuckin drawers and shit at man?
Man y'all niggaz was in here partyin too fuckin much
What the fuck y'all doin nigga?
Kurupt, go tell Daz man and Bogart and the rest of them niggaz
c'mon man, niggaz is trippin man
Front desk all callin me tellin me to get the hell outta here man
We gotta go (8X)
I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundred







Intro: Richie Rich, 2Pac
(RR) Pac
(PAC) Hey
(RR) What's happenin
(PAC) Not motherfuckin double R, Richie Rich
(RR) What's happenin baby, you know how we do it
(PAC) Yeah nigga, you know I'm up out this bitch
It's time for me to uhhh regulate
(RR) Fo' sho', hey
(PAC) Observe
(RR) and you ain't goin back
(PAC) Nah nah nah, we got to show these motherfuckers whassup though
(RR) This is for the honeys, the super size
(PAC) I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga
You feel me?
(RR) Well let em know
Verse One:
(Pac)
You fuckin wit niggaz that's insecure, watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me til you sure
I ain't beggin just tryin to relocate between ya legs
Drippin wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
You straight beggin to sex me got you undressin to test me and uhh..
(RR)
Shut me down if ya want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharin skirts
(Pac)
I hopin you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is bangin got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of tryin to make my songs pay
Makin love all day against the wall in the hallway
Ya fantasies come alive, ya heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this Thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga
Chorus: 2Pac
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a Thug in your life
Cause busters ain't lovin you right
(repeat 2X)
Verse Two: 
(Pac)
Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see ya blushin like ya want somethin, come get a taste
Of Amerikaz Most Wanted and let's get into some touchin, erotic fuckin
My up and down with no interruptions
Have no intentions of bustin until you learn ya lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass
(RR)
You can ride out the spoke coke, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga whose spoke coke can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we wind and grind
And when I'm on the field keep him on the sidelines
Chorus
Verse Three: 
(Pac)
Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got ya naked
Totally sweatin, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissin til yo' head swang, I'm so into you
Witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know, now scream my name out
Do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss playa, freaky motherfucker, can I dig
(RR)
Uhh, it's on and poppin, now you see what I was seein
Why yo' eyes rollin, Luke seen ya girl I ain't goin
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stresed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold da boots, and let a nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm goin home tonight
You say you don't need a man, but I don't care
You in the presence of a playa, I'd rather be ya nigga
Chorus 2.25X







Big Syke, Newt, Payne, Bogard, Big Serv
Y'all know how this shit go (you know)
All Eyez On Me
Muthafucka, Legit 
Roll up in the club and shit
All Eyez On Me
All Eyez On Me
But you know what
I bet you got it twisted 
You don't know who to trust
So many playa hating niggas trying to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they know it
Straight to the depths of hell is were those cowards goin'
Well are you still down nigga, Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry, but they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas, every time we ride (every time we ride)
Hitting muthafuckas up when we pass by (when we pass by)
Until I die Live the life of a  Boss playa, cuz even when I'm high
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyez
Cuz all I want is cash and thangs, 
A five double 0 Benz and flaunting flashy rings  Uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream, 
Been know to disappear before your eyez, just like a dope fiend, it seems
My main thang was to be major paid
The game sharper than a mutha-fuckin razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One niggas getting jealous, and muthafuckas died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They my homies for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas, and low riders, and ski masks
Screaming Thug Life every time they pass
All Eyez on Me
Live my life as a Thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live my life as a Boss playa (All eyez on me)
Cuz we be getting high
All Eyez on me
Live my life as a Thug nigga
Until the day I die
Live my life as a Boss playa (All eyez on me)
Cuz we be getting high
Hey, to my nigga Pac
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world changing everyday 
Times moving faaast
My girl said I need to raise up, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my women, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as we dip
I'm lost in the land, with no plan, living life flawless
Crime Boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm taking off on the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tek
Devoted to serving this, Moet and paaayyy checks
Like a kite sailin' nigga I'm forever Ballin' 
It ain't right, pair this ice triggas and fleas crawlin'
Sucka duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handling my business nigga keep on coastin'
Where yah goin' I been there came back as lonely homie
Steady flaunting against the grain nigga still don't know me
It's about the money, and the rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggas don't even know how to act shit
(Michel'le -- Chorus x2)
(You can run tha streetz with your Thugs)
I'll be waiting for you
until you get through
I'll be waiting)
(Tupac)
Now peep it
Here go tha secret on how to keep a playa
some love makin' and homecookin'
I'll see ya later
It don't take alot to keep a nigga hard
must be a lady in tha light
but real freaky in tha dark
plus I got some enemies, baby
hold my pistol
and wrap your arms around a nigga
everytime I kiss you
(Tupac) They say
Intro/Chorus:
(B-Legit) Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin
(C-Bo) Where I can pile up my chips
(Richie Rich) And niggaz call me a timer
(Tupac) I been ballin since my adolecsent years steady climbin
(E-40) Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin about no timin
(Tupac) That's right, that's right boy start that shit off
Verse One: 2Pac
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Picutes of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time on California crime
Watching for thievin I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin
Puttin a bullet in mutherfuckers give me a reason 
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded 
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin, too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin life after a night of fuckin around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme 
Then bring your big bad ass to California, cause we ain't hard to find
(B-Legit) Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin
(C-Bo) Where I can pile up my chips
(Richie Rich) And niggaz call me a timer
(Tupac) I been ballin since my adolecsent years steady climbin
(E-40) Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin about no timin
Verse Two: C-Bo, B-Legit
I got my locs on hard hat goin to war
Breakin them off on sight, stoppin lives like red lights
Watch em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, Tupac and the Click, smokin blunts, loadin clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick
I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O 
Where sellin narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find
Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin
That's while I keeps on grindin (that's right)
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a hoe, a hoe
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin
(B-Legit) Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin
(C-Bo) Where I can pile up my chips
(Richie Rich) And niggaz call me a timer
(Tupac) I been ballin since my adolecsent years steady climbin
(E-40) Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin about no timin
(Tupac) C-Bo and D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
(E-40) Da Bay, beitch!
Verse Three: E-40, Richie Rich
Down the steps  
Abandonded broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the drama play
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake although mine was first to ask niggaz
Motherfuckers didn't think I wasn't going do somethin, ask niggaz
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him
Check this out
I grew up with that nigga, threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin to ride, double-edgin for the other side
But now, my glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental keep my name out your dental
Nigga, if your gum bleedin, and you needin
Mo' than twenty sticthes, you behaved like dem bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game, check the resident it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find
(Tupac) Hell nah we ain't hard to find
(C-Bo) The whole clickilation fool
(E-40) Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch
(Tupac)
Why them niggaz actin like they can't find us
Like like they can't see us and
Like we don't be at the same spots they be at
It's the same congregation, Young Pac is back
YouknowhatImean?
(C-Bo) Nigga be lookin all the way when he see you and shit
It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
(E-40) Motherfuckers better understand this shit
(Tupac)
Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up?
Hey, we smokin, and we ain't hard to fine
Drinkin and shit, fuckin with some hurricane
(E-40) A motherfucker's gonna get his Marlboros regardless playa
(Tupac) You suPPOSED to
Sideways to the next light...







(Tupac Talking)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(All you gotta do is look)
(Tupac)
Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hoping my information, alleviates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
catch you smiling through your frown
California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rocking
We keep it rocking
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb-ass hemp beat
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean, mean, money-making machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-I-A
California 
 knows how to party 
California 
 knows how to party 
In the city of LA 
In the city of good old Watts 
In the city, city of Compton 
We keep it rocking 
We keep it rocking
My niggas say, come on
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali 
Shake it, shake it, baby 
Shake it, shake it, baby, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene I'm hearing hoochies screamin'
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player, where cowards die
And it's all war
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally to live and die
In LA we wearing Chucks, not Ballies 
Dressed in locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution; we collide with other crews
Famous 'cause we program worldwide
Let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know The Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-Town
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love
California 
 knows how to party
Really knows how to
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A. 
In the city of good old Watts 
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rocking
We keep it rocking
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali 
Shake it, shake it, baby 
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, mama 
Shake it Cali
Yeah, oh

Oaktown, Oakland definitely in the house
'Frisco, 'Frisco
Hey, you know L.A. up in this
Pasadena, where you at?

Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento, where you at? Yeah
Throw it up, y'all, throw it up, throw it up, I can't see you

"Alright now, here we go"
Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt
and freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and staying high til I die, my competion's zero
Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck
Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggaz know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggaz trip and yo it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggaz get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey
I'm getting sweated by these undercovers, who can I trust?
Got my mama stressin thinkin it's a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
We living a Drug Life, Thug Life, each day could be my last
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
That's the consequences when ya livin, fast
Six bricks of tricks, for my niggaz, I gotta come up
and recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures
Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover
over the fence and open fire
"Alright now, here we go"
These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?
I'm comin round the corner like I'm Magic
Doin ninety on the freeway, and hittin switches
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Don't turn around I ain't givin up, cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha
I got away cause I'm clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin loogies
at the coppers that persue me, beotch!
I be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas
"Alright now, here we go"
Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin bills, so I'm transportin weight
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin
Droppin keys like they stolen, hehe
Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me running from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin down a dirt road
But I ain't goin alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doing ninety, ahhhh shit!
Them bitches right behind me
They take a shot and hit my fuckin tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!
Hahahaha, Thug Life!







R U Still Down (repeat 3X)
Verse One: 2Pac
Now up and at em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And Mama told me be a Thug since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a, killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
All the time I was ballin, never heard my friends callin
Couldn't stop myself from fallin, I'm all in
Shit's gettin sleazy, believe me
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
Cause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought
I didn't have to run, now I'm duckin from the gun yellin, 'One-Time'
Take your time to feel my record, and if you did
chill a second, my blind method, will still wreck it
My young homies stay strong
I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone, R U Still Down?
Chorus: 2Pac
Raise em up... R U Still Down?
(repeat 5X)
Verse Two: 2Pac
I'm gettin high, so a nigga think he touch the sky
Turn tough inside, in the rush to die
Livin life as a Thug time to face the truth
What's goin on with the wasted youth, please God
come and save me (save me), had to work with what ya gave me
And got a nigga goin crazy
I can't read the signs, I'm blind, but a nigga know
he need his nine, cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
and my niggaz on the streets, man listen
Cause these ain't the old days
Ain't no way I'ma bustin my ass and gettin no pay
It seems I can't find my focus, and homey I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
Lord knows, its hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin lace niggaz with the game
wanna see me locked in chains, tryin to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin, see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
This one nigga got the town in fear, but R U Still Down
Chorus
Verse Three: 2Pac
I wrote this for my critics and my, enemies
Last year ya used to love me, huh REMEMBER ME
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin to jail
Just as well, cause my life on the streets - a living Hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped, and mercy Lord
Come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone, and so I'm angry
I never did nothin wrong, my mama told me, Baby it's on
And now I'm hustlin and bustlin bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin cheese
Buyin all the things on TV, and gettin skeezed
Wish my homeboys could see me now
Little bad motherfucker runnin wild through the town
Please tell me, R U Still Down?
R U Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me (repeat 2X)
R U Still Down, to raise em up?
R U Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me (repeat 3X)
R U Still Down, to raise em up?
R U Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me (repeat 3X)
R U Still Down, to raise em up?
That's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin middle finger
RAISSSSE em up
These hoes can't fade me, don't these bitches know we crazy?
Thug Life, niggaz, be, the sickest
You feel me? Now get that shit written down
God damn!
Took four years and a motherfuckin case for these motherfuckers to feel me
Ain't that a bitch?
R U Still motherfucking down?
Old hoe ass fake ass niggaz
We out this motherfucker







Major! Hell motherfuckin yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Coolin, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellrazor... 
Born thuggin
Heartless and mean, muggin at sixteen
On the scene watchin fiends buggin
Kickin up dust with the older G's
Soakin up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot, I learned
not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes, was taught lessons
A young nigga askin questions while other suckers was guessin
I was ganked for sexin
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary, I'm cuttin class
and I'm buckin blastin, straight mashin
Mobbin through the overpass laughin
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? I keep my finger in the trigger
Cause some nigga tried to kill me
and mama raised a hellraizor, everyday gettin paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'ma spark til I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein black
Dear Lord can ya feel me, gettin major, unhh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Lord be my savior, unnh
(Repeat 4X)
Mama raised a hellrazor
Dear Lord can ya feel me
Stress gettin major, unnh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Tell me Lord can ya feel me, show a sign
Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin
Mama raised a hellrazor, can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggaz
I'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the po' babies restin in the early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
crooked cop killin Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggaz burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin blunts
Gettin drunk off that Tanqueray gin
Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin pen
Mama raised a hellrazor, uhh, yeah
C'mon, uhh, mama raised a hellrazor
Uhh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin major
(Lord be my savior, unnh)
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Lord be my savior, unhh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Lord be my savior, unhh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin please come and SAVE ME
THE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, I cause shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin high till they bury me
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news I see busta girl killin 'Tasha
Now I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end
it's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
with my hands on the trigger, Thug nigga
Stressin like a motherfuckin drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die

and I ain't West Coast for these niggas on the West huh?
Fuck e'rybody
Heh heh heh...
Thug style out this muthafucka niggas throw ya hands in the air
If you got Jeep make ya speakers pop
I want muthafucking police trying to pull niggas over on this one
We taking this one to the whole 'nother level gutter style Thug style
You feel me, things that we can only do as a real G
We ain't dead yet, hit me!!
Verse 1
I got my Hennessy find ya foes 
in a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes
I'm getting high off buddha
'Cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough
you never find me broke
and who meee a nigga livin' life like a G
in that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep living in these wicked times
peep, niggas after me 'cause they see I'm stacking G's and heat
You can holler if you want to pleeease
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew bleeeed
enemies and my range is on
you're in the danger zone
my fuckin' game is strong, Hotline
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
from hustling and busting them rhymes
to my niggas up in Quentin
Down on Riker's Isle stay rile
But a nigga gotta use his styles
These,
Chorus
Niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
Verse 2
I could be wrong but I never got along with cops
it's like they stuck
from making niggas duck from Glocks all the time
my mind's full of thoughts of ends
I'm still rolling my bucket but I bought me a Benz (tadow)
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
cause in the dark see they hearts' full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
only me inside the cell
Straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucka screaming like the demon's inside
will 'em away in the morning
Only the strong survive
I cry but in my own way
Swallow my pride pick a reason to hide
from all the niggas that die (Rest in Peace)
cemetary full of brothers I buried
It's going down even now I wonder
will I still be around my hometown is the gutter
I was born a wild came up out this dust
with my heartless style
These,
Chorus
Niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
Verse 3
I remember Uptown huh got to get to listenin'
to Mr. Magic cuttin' up the hits
and even though I had habit makin' words rhyme
I was caught up in the madness
Juvenile thugs come on
I tell the whole story nothin' but truth
Halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs
and Pete and Lee young G's
with a gift of gab and tryin' to hook up with the hookers
who was quick to stab remember mama's cooking
No school straight hookin'
and tryin' to get with light skinned
cause she good looking
And jumpin' over turnstiles 'cause we ain't paying
call the cuties cuss words but we only playing (biotch)
I'm prayin' I can get a buck no luck
I had to move around a lot
'cause my moms was stuck
I had family but I was way too wild
had to move to the West to regain my style
These,
Chorus 'til end with ad libs







Power.. pow.. power...
Guess who's back? Hahaha, here we go
It's ninety-fo', what's next?
Power.. enter my world
I guess this year gonna be a motherfucker for real niggaz
I swear these playa haters done got a taste of power
It ain't all good in the hood
Least not on my side, from where I stand
And the law? Man, fuck the law!
Niggaz must outthink, outstep, and continuously outsmart
the motherfuckin law, in every way
Key word in ninety-four is 'down low'
Gots to be struggling
I see how the rich got theirs
Nigga I'm legit, shit
Where do we go from here?
(Who's afraid, of the punk police?
To my niggaz run the streets, fuck peace) -- repeat in background
Heyyy niggaz, where your heart at?
See motherfuckers killin babies, killin mommas
Killin kids, puttin this in they motherfuckin mark
Now what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race
before he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire?
These crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns
Jails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs
And they wonder why we loc'n up
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?
*singers singing variations of 'Where do we go from here'*
All you niggaz out there
The clouds shook, the world listened
We stood together in April of ninety-two
With duty, and a sense of honor
There is no limit to what WE can achieve
That's all on us... us...
Not my niggaz, not the whites, not the enemies
or none of them motherfuckers, US
What can WE do? Shit
I declare a death sentence to all child molestors
Fake-ass bitches, male and female
And all you punk-ass snitches
We can do without your asshole
Let no man break, what we set
Where do we go from here?
Rest in peace, to Cato, I miss you
All the other real G's that passed away in ninety-three
In ninety-four, and more
What do we do? For us?







Chorus: I wonder if heaven got a ghetto (4X)
I was raised, the little young nigga doin bad shit
Talk much shit cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault papa didn't plan it out
Broke out left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Down the block, got a glock, and I clock grip
Makin G's was my mission
Movin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen and
why must I sock a fella, just to live large like Rockefeller
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
God damn it's a motherfuckin riot
Black people only hate police so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right but it's long overdue
We can't have peace til the niggaz get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Chorus
Verse Two: 2Pac
Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, LaTasha, and many more
It's been goin on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, when will the violence cease?
When your troops stop shootin niggaz down in the street
Niggaz had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Word to God cause it's hard tryin to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit now everything's free
so we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin from them, cause for years they would take it from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggaz burned it down
And now Bush can't stop the hit
Predicted the shit, in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggaz, felt good
in the hood bein around the niggaz, yeah
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Chorus
Verse Three: 2Pac
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it take to make this
one better place, let's erase the wait state
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black President, huh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a ne-gro
Pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero
Mo' nigga mo' nigga mo' niggaz
I'd rather be dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out 
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out 
Pray to my God everyday but he don't listen 
The poverty bothers me but mama's working wonders in the kitchen 
Listen I can hear her crying in the bedroom 
Praying for money we never think would she be dead soon 
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else 
At 13 can't feed myself 
Can I blame daddy 'cause he left me 
Wish he would've helped me 
Too much like him 'til my mama don't love me 
On my own at a early age gettin' paid 
And I'm strapped so I'll never be afraid 
Where did I go astray I'm hanging in the back streets 
Running with G's and dope fiends will they jack me? 
Can't turn back my eyes on the prize 
I got nothing to lose 
Everybody gotta die 
Say good-bye to the bad guy 
That one you fucked when you passed by 
Buck buck (gunshots) from a Glock 
Tempered glass fly 
Do or Die walk a mile in my shoes 
And you'd be crazy too 
With nothing to lose 
I got nothing to lose (That's why I got gang related) 
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 
I thank the Lord for my many blessings 
Though I'm stressin' keep a vest for protection 
From the barrel of the Smith & Wesson 
And all my niggas in the pen' 
Here we go again 
Ain't nothing separating us from a mack 10 
Born in the ghetto as a hustla' older 
Straight soldier bucking at them bustas 
No matter how you try niggas never die 
We just retaliate with hate then we multiply 
See me striking down the block hittin' co'ners 
Mobbin' like a motherfucka' livin' like I want to 
Ain't no stoppin' at the red lights I'm sideways 
Thug Life muthafucka criiime pays 
Let the cops put they lights on 
Chase me nigga 
Zig-zaggin' through the freeway 
Race me nigga 
In a high speed chase with the law 
The realest muthafucka that you ever saw 
I'm livin' raw 'til they bury me don't worry me 
I'm high livin' like I ain't afraid to die 
And you could walk a mile in my shoes 
And you'd be crazy too 
I got nothing to lose (That's why I got gang related) 
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 
Ain't no escape from a deadly fate 
And everyday there's a million black bodies put away 
I'm startin' to lose hope 
It seems everybody's on dope 
Mama told me to leave 'cause she was broke 
Sometimes I choke on the indo 
Peepin' out the window alone on my own 
I'm a criminal 
Got no love from the household I'm out cold 
In the streets give me motherfuckin' peace 
I got nothing to lose 
And something to prove 
What do I do live Thug Life nigga stay true 
I wonder when they kill me 
Is there a Heaven for a real G 
Lord forgive me if you feel me 
'Cause all my life I was dirt broke 
With no hope lil' skinny muthafucka wantin' dough 
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade 
But everyday it's a struggle to get major paid 
Anyway it's so hard on a nigga in this city 
No pity and ain't no love for the scrubs that be buyin' time 
If you could walk a mile in my shoes you'd be crazy too 
With nothing to lose 
I got nothing to lose (That's why I got gang related) 
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga 
We be the craziest, motherfucka'!
You know! 
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga 
We be the craziest!







Get money nigga
Yeah - aw yeah
Dedicate this one to all the hustlers
that get up every motherfuckin mornin and put they work in
I see you - I see you boy
I'm up before sunrise first to hit the block
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of rocks
Learned to throw them thangs, get my skinny lil' ass kicked
Niggaz laughed, til the first motherfucker got blas-ted
I put the nigga in his casket
and now they covering the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular fuck when it counts
Tryin to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce
Gettin ghost on the five-oh, fuck them hoes
Got a forty-five screamin out surviv-al
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some ya-yo
and holla five-oj when I say so
Don't wanna go to the pen, I'm hittin fences
NARC's on a nigga back missin me by inches
And they say how do you survive, weighin one-fifty-five
in the city where the little niggaz die
Tell mama don't cry, cause even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a real G
I'm gettin money (4x)
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin
Kinda boomin round the way, think today I make a killin
Dressin down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin from the cops
Gettin high I think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
drinkin liquor and I'm lookin for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin money, than live poor and legal
as I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my girl, she gettin paid today, ha hah ha
I live Thug Life and let the money come to me
Cause they can never take the game from a young G
I'm gettin money (4X)
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too
RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
at point blank range cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed, they shakin the dice
Now roll em if you can't stand pain better hold em
Cause ain't no tellin what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it
And even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a young G
I'm gettin money (5X)

With them bitches they be freaky

Gunnin' niggas down cause they plastic 
Sleep on a G and get that ass kicked 
And stuffed in a casket 
Rippin' the shit like it's my motherfucking last hit 
Hey they wonder why a nigga's nothin' nice 
And every time I bust a nut I fuck for Tyson 
Cause I know the real on the bitch

Fuck 'em...Fuck all y'all
Verse 1
Money gone fuck friends

Remember me I'm ya homie that was down to brawl
Sippin' Hennessy hanging with the clowns and
all we used to do is drink brew, screw and common knew

You can throw ya middle finger if ya feel me loc

It took time but finally the cash was mine

and when you stuck where the fuck is all ya friends
They straight busted and can't be trusted fuck y'all
Chorus
Fuck all y'all 2x
Verse 2
I'm sippin' Tanqueray and juice and what's the use

Ain't no love reminiscing on how close we was

It's gettin' rough collect calls from my niggas in court
I recollect we used to ball now just living's enough

Thug for life scrawled all across the wall

I know it's gettin' crazy after dark
these marks keep on huffin' and puffin'
ain't no fear in my heart

Fuck all y'all
Chorus 3x
Verse 3
I went from rags to riches quick

And even though I know the cops behind me

Fuck the law give a shit I'm even worse than before
I know they wanna see a nigga buried
but I ain't worried still throwing these thangs
got me locked in these chains

And when I hit the streets I'm in a rush to ball
I'm screaming Thug Life nigga fuck y'all
Repeat of intro

Nobody's, closing me out of my business (repeat 2X)
(2Pac) My definition of a thug nigga
Nobody's, closing me out of my business
Verse One: 2Pac
I played the cards I was given, thank God I'm still livin
Pack my nine til it's time to go to prison
As I'm bailin down the block that I come from, still gotta pack a gun
Case some young motherfuckers wanna play dumb
I guess I live life forever jugglin
But I'll be hustlin til the early mornin cause I'm strugglin
Like drinkin liquor make the money come quicker
Gettin pages from my bitch it's time to dick her
I ain't in love with her, I just wanna be the one to hit her
Drop off and let the next nigga get her
That's the way it goes, it's time to shake a hoe, make the dough
Break a hoe when it's time to make some mo'
I keep my finger on the trigger of my Glock
Ridin down the block lickin shots at the punk-ass *cops*
And spittin game through my mobile phone
The type of shit to get them hoes to bone
My Definition of a Thug Nigga
Chorus: (various samples)
Tis the season, to be servin What you doin?
Mob-mobbin like a motherfucker 
(repeat 3X)
Tis the season, to be servin 
Verse Two: 2Pac
Well I roll with a crew of zoo niggaz
They're quick to pulle a nine when it's time do niggaz
Comin through like I'm two niggaz, a true nigga fuck a Zig Zag
Roll me a blunt and pass that brew nigga
I'm drivin drunk on the freeway, so take it ea-sy
Lookin for a new face to skeeze me
Everybody's lookin for a nut but I'm searchin for the big bucks
Give a fuck, rather die than be stuck
In a one-room shack, and, kickin back
Daydreamin with the nine in my lap (huh)
So how's that from the mind of a Thug Nigga
Bought a fo'-five cause I heard that the slug's bigger
Figure the first motherfucker to jump'll find hisself
Gettin swept off his feet by the pump
I put that on my moms, word to the motherfuckin trigger
Before I go broke I'll be a drug dealer, a Thug Nigga
Chorus
Verse Three: 2Pac
Short than a motherfucker snatched up by one-time
Make a phone call and be back to ball by lunchtime
So here we go, we in the inner city
I keep my hand on my gat and stay cool, my attitude is shitty
Niggaz don't like me cause I'm makin ends
Roll in a Benz and I blaze a blunt, cause I'm all in
And any nigga trying to take what I got'll
Hafta deal with the sixteen-shot Glock (huh)
So here we go, I can't be faded
Happy in the motherfucker, finally made it
Got my money in my pocket, finger on the trigger
And I ain't takin shit from no niggaz
I'm just tryin to make some money right
Put some motherfuckin food in my tummy right
I'm feelin good like I'm supposed to, ready to ball
Find a spot and we can serve em all
My Definition of a Thug Nigga
Outro: (various samples)

(Rule number one... niggaz die, daily, hahahaha)
Hear me! Boo-yaow!

What type nigga be a Thug Life nigga?
Them Thug Life niggaz be the craziest -- run up nigga!)
There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame
Niggaz die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Puffin on blunts and gettin drunk to keep from goin under
Gettin lost in the madness, blunted gettin tipsy
Got my pistol out the window screamin, "Lord come and get me"
Am I sick, or am I just another victim?
Unloadin my clip, I'm watchin every bullet spit when I kick em
Niggaz die from automatic gunfire
Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggaz that's caught
Had a motherfuckin ward but he didn't go to court
God damn, and one day we'll all be together
Until then I'm ready for whatever, c'mon
(Yeah, niggaz movin somethin in the nine-trey
It's all about makin money, gettin yours
And knockin coppers off the motherfuckin planet
Word to the motherfuckin nine nigga

If they don't feel me, they gon kill me
So Syke, get skanless nigga)
Am I going to Hell or will I reach Heav-en? (hell naw)
After all this shit I did with my Mac-11
Did I sell my soul? Mama woulda saved me
That's the way that daddy raised me
Oh God, help me I'm losin it
So fuck it! Take me I'm doin it!
I need to change and look for a better way
I got a hundred round clip to my AK
Commitin sins I might die in vain
So fuck it! We'll live off the street fame!
God didn't send me in the right direction
I'm gettin hit by a diesel in the intersection
I know you're out there help a young brother (hear me)
Til then I'ma smoke motherfuckers
Things wouldn't be so bad
if we got the things that we never had, I'm ready for whatever
(Hahahahaha, that's my motherfuckin nigga there
Big ballin-ass Syke

Dear mama I know you worry cause I'm hardly at home
Every other night in jail, got you patient by the phone
Wanna shake it cause I can't take it got me livin in Hell
Like I'm walkin with a secret that'll kill me if I tell
I live the Thug Life and can't nobody, change me
Not to the brain, going insane, just a part of the game
So much caine in the fast lane, finally a dry eye
When I die, bury me with my fo'-five
And let the devil feel the wrath of a nigga
Goin to Hell with my finger on the trigger
Now everybody's starin
Got a nigga losin hair and they wonder if I'm all there
Well don't blame me, blame the flame that flickers

Damn...

When I get free...
Oh shit!
Get free...
Yeah yeah
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
Then bitches is foul, take a look at the evening news
You'll see a nigga gettin' cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin' to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryin' to dirty up my name, but
I'm slippin' quick as the wind, It's me or them
Fuck friends my foes be on a mission tryin' to do me in
Fuck'em I'm bout to get out, they all soft
I blow up like gauge, and in a rage blow they balls off
Why are you niggaz tryin' to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitches
Main thang was to make a nigga meal ticket
Only if you the real, the nigga will kick it
I'll enforce it with the steel use the lessons that i learned in jail
Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell
Network with connects that I got in the pen
In no time I'll be clockin' again
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
Still sittin' in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin' to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
Quick call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin' maybe
me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
Cause she keep on callin' me baby
To a young motherfucker facin' eighty
that's enough to make you crazy
Now how long will it take, to get her hooked
Got her watchin' me liftin' weights, sneakin' looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives the van
Ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin' it to Hell
All them niggaz that was frontin' while I sat up in the cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned your misery
Then nigga you don't want to see
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
Stuck in my cell
The pen ain't nuttin' like the county jail
When will they let me bail?
Walkin' through the yard, I play the God
First Nigga disrespect me first nigga gettin' scarred
I'm, back on the scene
I'm hitin' knees in the back of a limousine, puffin on weed
as we game on the drunk hoes
Hit the skunk I reminisce just on the way
we used to play, you punk hoes
What I possess is to be rich, in currency
Paranoid niggaz like bitches whan they come and see me
Laid out, played out, the nigga barely breathin'
As for that bullshit punk, nigga n-now we even
But I wait, until it's time and try to find a crooked way
to porfit off this crime
This life of mine..until I get free
My prophecy is niggaz screamin', as if they bleed in agony
As soon as they popped my gate
I knew these motherfuckers made a mistake
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free
Hahaha... yeah nigga, when i get motherfuckin free
Pop the gate, I'm back baby!
When I get free... we up out this bitch







Hold on...
Yeah it's gonna be alright, don't trip baby 
It'll get better... 
Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to em bet
It's all good, uhh
I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin by
And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin, they all tried to help to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin me down
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
There's, never a good day, cause in my hood they
let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin gettin high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
I know them ain't tears comin down your face
Wipe your eyes
In this world
Only the strong survive y'know
Hmm, I know it's hard out there
Welfare
AIDS, earthquakes
Muggings, carjackings
Yeah we got problems
But believe me when I tell you
Things always get better
God don't like ugly
And God don't like no quitters
You know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee
God bless the child that can hold his own
Y'know?
You got to stand strong
And when these bustas try to knock you out your place
You stand there to they face
Tell em hold on, and be strong
The game don't stop
Hmmm
This here is black main
If you don't never leave nothin, learn one thing
It don't stop, til the casket drop
Thug, for Life... feel me?
All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad, especially come the first and the fifteenth
Stay strong, and stay ballin, hold on
I'll catch y'all at the next life, we in traffic







Straight out the motherfucking bay
Here we go
Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling whooped tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a hoe and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a liar
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
*little kid* Tell me about these fake ass bitches
(2Pac)
Look here little nigga
Most of these niggaz be bitches too
but you'll never hear that side of the story
So uhh, we finna do this shit like this
It's like I tell my niggaz, keep your eyes on these bitches
They love to G a nigga young dumb and gettin riches
What the fuck you think a trick is nigga
Nigga done stick and wet his dick
and then get tricked out all his riches by a -- BITCH!
I'm here to school you to the rules of the game, it'll cost ya
Think you alla that just cause she let a nigga toss her
It's like a motherfuckin priveledge
So don't give up your conversation, give that bitch your 7 digits
When she call ya, ask that little tramp whassup
And if she hesitates nigga hang up, worrrd up
And let that bitch meditate to the dial tone
And call me when you're ready to bone, and it's on
A motherfucking mack tonight
Stay that stay strapped cause my raps is tight
You fuckin punks, I hate you snitches
Went against the grain and the game to be fake ass bitches
(God, damn! You can't just hit them niggaz with that game
and expect them to accept it; girl your heard me it gets skanless.
But we gonna kick this shit like this here)
Chorus: 2Pac
I can't stand fake ass bitches
Lyin ass niggaz and you punk ass snitches
(repeat 2X)
Time to show these bustas who's boss
Run up on a real motherfucker and get tossed
The game is deep, and thicker than a motherfuckin jimmy
Broke hoes runnin round yellin Gimme!
I can't stand it, hoes talkin bout they got a man
Shit all I wanted her to do is suck my DICK
So how about hittin a motherfucker on my pager
Busy now bitch but you can give me the pussy later
Fly how I fade her, played her like a game of Sega
Fuckin with the player that made her, huh
And I ain't sleepin caught you creepin for my money
Got the dick and now you get the pistol honey (bitch)
So get the bozack, knockin hoes back, keep my dough stacked
So where the motherfuckin hoes at?
Punk niggaz can't fade the mack, livin fat
Gettin paid to rap, it's like that, you motherfuckin bitches
Yeah, yeah that's my motto

Chorus 2X
Oh you too nigga, don't think we ain't talkin bout your punk ass

Fake ass motherfuckin bitch, die in ninety-four







Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha
I shoulda seen
you was trouble right from the staaaaaart,
taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
we had some problems but we workin at it, and now
the arguments are gettin loud, don't wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
... that's right, sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm fellin happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do?
So now I'm back
to makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin close
To packin up and leavin notes, and gettin ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
when we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin calls at the house, guess you cheatin
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin, I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love
... damn, sucka for love... sucka for love
... sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Now he left you with scars,
tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost,
trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
but I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love
... sucka for love,
know you ain't right G but yet I'ma sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
... I'ma sucka for love, sucka for love
... Sucka for love
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up







Young Thugs in this motherfucker
Don't break up the fight, let 'em rumble
Don't make enemies with me
I Try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Some say my criminal experience is legendary
I do what's necessary
Niggas wanna see me burried
Worried, if you coming hurried
I ain't going down, fuck the world I'm a thug
Tell 'em can't nothing stop me but a slug
I went from drug dealing to a shot caller
From off the block, no longer rock
And putting money in my pocket, nationwide baller
Bitch nigga I'm prepared to die, Before I fry
I hit the weed so I be forever high
My eyes has seen so much in misery, So before I flee
I open fire let the lord pick the first to bleed
Bitches don't wanna see me leave, forever thugging
Tell 'em bury me a G on everything I love
And fuck the law 'cause the raw niggas ain't free
This picture's clear but we can't see, hahaha
This game is jealousy, Don't let 'em change
That's what they keep on telling me, motherfuck the fame
I can't sleep 'cause I keep hearing peeps
Straight outta Oakland, California where we spark it on ya
Give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
I remember drinkin Hennesey, smokin weed
Fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
Had a partner named Snoop, loved to clown a stank
Smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
Shooting craps in the alley til they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies but don't waste it all
Oooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
On my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
Having house parties in a crowded spot
And you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
Everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
Lookin dumb, cause you waitin for your chance to hump
Straight grindin, everybody havin fun
And it's cool til a fool pull a loaded gun
Cause another dude kicked his Bacardi over
He had to act a fool now the party's over
Gun shots rang like it's thunder
And everybody bum rushing and I'm rushing to get a number
Says she got a man but she's lying
Why? I seen her talking to this other guy and..
he's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
I ain't trippin I just hope he get em, I got nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
I love to go back, to the block I got my game from
Cause uh, old man still drinkin, his breath still stinkin
He'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin
But I can't diss him he's my elder
He been livin here longer what that tell ya?
And little girls playin double dutch
Still blush, cause she don't get in trouble much
It's uhh, ponytails and barrettes
I gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
And little boys playin stick ball, quick y'all
Get out the street before they hit y'all
And as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss
And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be
Feels good to be back on the streets
Cause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see
Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers getting rich slangin crack to folks
And the square's getting big for these sack of dope
Started thinking bout a plan to get paid myself
So I made myself, raised myself
Til the dealer on the block told me, "That ain't cool
You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool"
I got my game about women from a prostitute
And way back used to rap on the block for loot
I tryed to make my way legit, haha
But it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
And uhh, it was funny how I copped out
I couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out
My family on welfare
I'm steady thinking, since don't nobody else care
I'm out here on my own
At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone
I'm feelin like a waste, tears rollin down my face
Cause my life is filled with hate
Until I looked around me
I saw nothing but family, straight up down for me
Panthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs
Hey yo, that's my family tree, I got nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
ain't got nuttin but love for ya
ain't got nuttin but love for ya (repeats to fade)







Death Row
That's where motherfuckers is endin up
Dear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I rob my adversaries, but Slick done left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch
Should I shoot his bitch, or make the nigga rich?
Don't wanna commit murder, but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while I'm walkin, and talkin behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it
Cause life's a Wheel of, Fortune here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me
Niggaz gettin jealous (jealous) tryin to find my stash
Whip out the nine, now I'ma dive and pump your ass
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch, and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin, but swear I'm nothin nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these, mics
I listen to him scream, Tray Deee went insane
I guess the little, mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little, bird, he snitched and told a, friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old timers
And fuck five-oh, blaow blaow.. turn em into forty-niners
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where they find me? 16 on Death Row
Dear mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime, cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my set, is 16 is wet
It's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin Hell
I shouldn'ta let him catch me
Instead of livin sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm, you can hear his asshole gettin torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin sheep, niggaz countin cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me (why?)
Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin dead from a rope, 16 on Death Row
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where you find me? 16 on Death Row
Dear mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin every breath
I'm bitter cause I'm dyin, so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed, your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society that doesn't give a shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book, that motherfucker never cared for me
He's only here to be sure
I don't drop a dime to God bout the crimes he's commitin
on the poor, and how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers and in all these years, they ain't never love me
I never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
to keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin motherfuckers
Steer clear of these Aryan motherfuckers
Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin shot
I'm convinced self-defense is the way
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin for the chair
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where we live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where you find me? 16 on Death Row
16 on Death Row
It's to all my partners in the penitentiaries
16 on Death Row







Chorus: I wonder if heaven got a ghetto (4X)
I was raised, the little young nigga doin bad shit
Talk much shit cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault papa didn't plan it out
Broke out left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Down the block, got a glock, and I clock grip
Makin G's was my mission
Movin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen and
why must I sock a fella, just to live large like Rockefeller
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
God damn it's a motherfuckin riot
Black people only hate police so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right but it's long overdue
We can't have peace til the niggaz get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Chorus
Verse Two: 2Pac
Here on Earth, tell me what's a blick life worth
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, LaTasha, and many more
It's been goin on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, when will the violence cease?
When your troops stop shootin niggaz down in the street
Niggaz had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Word to God cause it's hard tryin to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit now everything's free
so we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin from the, cause for years they would take it from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggaz burned it down
And now Bush can't stop the hit
Predicted the shit, in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggaz, felt good
in the hood bein around the niggaz, yeah
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Chorus
Verse Three: 2Pac
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it take to make this 
one better place, let's erase the wait state
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black President, huh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a ne-gro
Pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero
Mo' nigga mo' nigga mo' niggaz
I'd rather be dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Ay Trusty Trusty, what you want man?
Oh nigga let me get one of them ciggarettes, damn!
Shit, come on bastard, get the phone for a nigga
Use the phone, oh nigga get the phone for me man
What's the number? 323-6545, tell her it's Pac
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
I heard a snicker a laugh, I take a look at the evening news
And see a nigga gettin cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryina dirty up my name, but
I slip as quick as the wind, it's me again, fuck friends
My foes be on a mission, tryin to do me in
Fuck em I'm out to get out, they all thought
I blow up like gauge, and in a rage blow they balls off
Why are you niggaz tryin to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch
Maintain with a nigga meal ticket only if you with the real
The nigga will kick it, I'll enforce it with the steel
These are lessons that I learned in jail
Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell
Now I'm workin with connects that I got in the pen
In no time I'll be clockin again
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
Heyyy, still sittin in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
Quick call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin maybe
me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
Cause she keep on callin me baby, to a young
motherfucker facin eighty that's enough to make me crazy
Now how long will it take, to get a hook
Got her watchin me liftin weights, sneakin looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives
but man, ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin it to Hell
all them niggaz that was frontin while I sat up in a cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned, in misery
The nigga you don't wanna see
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, believe that shit
Yeah nigga fuck your cigarette, fuck that Marlboro motherfucker
I'll be out this motherfucker in a few days
I'll pay these bitches back in spades
Punk ass bastards, long as my AK flexes
we gonna play these bitches
That's how we do this shit
Fuck that I'm out, C.O. turn the fuckin lights out!







Against all odds, I'm still here nigga
Aiyyy, I got to get my props for 2Pacalypse
O.P.D. -- what??!
When this album come out, niggaz can kiss my ass
Did you think I'd fall?
You think you could stop a motherfucker like me?
Introducing you to my criminal crew
Treach, A.D., Apache, Essential
You got to deal with me on a whole new level motherfucker
Above the Law, Lench Mob, the Underground
Cause I'm gettin paid
gets around and we down in this bitch
And the more you try to keep niggaz away from me
the more I unite with mo' niggaz and mo' niggaz and mo' niggaz
Extra special thanks to my nigga Big John Major
And it's a ghetto in every city and a nigga in every ghetto
I owe him, thanks to my man Mike Cooley and the rest of out fathers
Motherfucker we are unstoppable
And uhh, I'm not goin alive!







Pssst... psssssst... aiyyo
Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever
Tell me, which one?
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- I'm losin my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine and my vision's blurry
Fallin to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord
but he ignores me unfortunately cause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless -- I'm chokin off
marijuana smoke, with every toke it's like I'm losin focus
Fallin to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin, and goin nutty
And reminiscin bout them niggaz that murdered my buddy
I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin funny
Flashbacks of bustin caps, anything for money
Where am I goin I discovered, can't nothin save me
My next door neighbor's havin convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn'ta did it
Everybody's dyin am I next, who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin, two to the head
while I'm in bed, leakin blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller? I'm gettin suspicious
of this bitch the line busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin all her homies -- that I can fuck her
like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure gettin drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennesey I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies they creepin, don't make me blast
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfuckers pass
by me like they know me, smilin as they laugh
I put up my middle finger then I dash
Niggaz don't like me cause I'm Thuggin, and every day
I'm a hustler lookin to get paid
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest I'm losin homies, ain't that a bitch
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?
Then tell me am I lost cause I'm lonely
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer?  I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay Thuggin with a passion, forever blastin
I'm bustin on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound... well Hell
can't be worse than this, cause I'm in Hell now
Don't make me hurt you I don't want to, but I will
See motherfuckers killed over green bills
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin mack
I love it cause in heaven there's no shortage on G's
I'm tellin you now, you motherfuckers don't know me
Only fear of death..        You ghetto niggaz
Only fear of death is comin back reincarnated
(repeats continously w/ variations)
Hahaha, I ain't scared to die
I ain't scared to die
To my homies in heaven
I ain't scared to die
Do you wanna live forever?
Are you scared, to die?
Or will you scream, when you fry?
I don't fear death
My only fear of death is comin back, reincarnated
This is dedicated to Mental, R.I.P.
And Big Kill, R.I.P.
And all you other O.G.'s, who go down
I don't fear death











Little somethin for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corrine
Verse One:
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uhh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin to gas ya up, I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up
Chorus
Ooooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooooh child things are gonna get brighter
Ooooh child things are gonna get easier
Ooooh child things are gonna get brighter
Verse Two:
Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it's funny when it rains and pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
They say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
there ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up
Chorus
Verse Three:
And uhh
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don't fall down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getten older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
I'm still tryin to hold on to survivin friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
please... you got to keep your head up

(Snoop)

Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker
(2Pac)
Now follow as we riiiiide

Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me

Bow down in the presence of a boss player
(Snoop)
It's like cuz, blood, gangbangin
Everybody in the party doin dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard til ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids
(2Pac)
They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floatin in the black Benz, tryin to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill, on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted
Chorus (w/ variations to end)







Yo Mo Bee main, drop that shit!
Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy
You know what time, boo-yaow
I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand youknowhatI'msayin
And uhh, throw up that finger
Ay yo yo yo throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?
Verse One:
Tell me baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if ya only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong love tell me, cause I get caught up
and the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see
the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard
I've been known to clown and Get Around, that's my word
See you walkin and you lookin good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin me
witcha attitude to match right, don't be phony
cause I hate when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin in the spotlight, I want the fame
but the industry's a lot like, a crack game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be wit you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go...
Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy 
Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go..
Give them the finger!
Ya know what baby it's like
*singing*
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care
Verse Two:
Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
in my ride and I'm all in, gettin high
I can hear the people callin, I'm passin by
Everybody knows I'm ball-in, and to God
Gotta keep myself from fall-in, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do
Gettin shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
in your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve
Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates, do you wanna fall up in heaven
Don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was...
Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy
Give em the finger!
All my homies go..
Throw your fingers up!
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like
*singing*
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care
Verse Three:
A lot of people think it's easy, to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me, in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin up the telephone, reminiscin
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin, you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin
See you later, cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was
Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy
Give em the finger
And all my homies go.. 
yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?
Throw your fingers up
Y'know? 
They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you
*singing*
Everybody, heyy, alright
Heyy, heyyyeah, heyyyayyy, ohh
(2Pac)
All my niggaz go
Uptown in the
Give em the finger!
Throw your hands up
Give em the finger!







2pac:
Rest in peace to my mothafucka Biggie Smalls
That's right boy, it's goin on
Right here, Thug Life
God bless the dead
God bless the dead & buried nigga
Don't worry if you see God first tell Him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you're representin the crew
And I can picture you in Heaven with a blunt & a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlas, caught up in the whirlwind
The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggie
Sayin shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin mothafuckas plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin, never meant to do time
My epitaph will read "Was the last of Gs
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead"
Chorus - 2pac:
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
2pac:
Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucka wantin to hang
I can see 'em in my head, pow
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin back in my yearbook all the years took
Half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die will they all shed tears
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoid got me lookin in the mirror
Behind me, life without my nine, I'd rather do the time
See I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
Fuck the police & all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin
By keepin gun & never run unless I'm comin at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead
Chorus
2pac:
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckas that passed too early
All the young motherfuckas that was took in they prime
Real motherfuckin Gz, this one is for you
Yo Stretch, Biggie
Stretch:
Yo Big this is to you my nigga
Springfield Hollis crew, Thug Life, YGz
Sendin they respect, know I mean?
You my nigga for life, forever
You're always gonna be with a nigga
No matter what, don't forget that
I pray before I go to sleep
Dear God save my place before I start to eat, cause times is hard
So I'm covered to my knees, oh why?
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock I buy?
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, uzi weighin a ton
Niggas terrified of comin from the young gun
Hearin that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind blowin, so I'm flowin goin crazy
Slip for cock the gun but he didn't run like a punk
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
For spunk is what he had, kid, I'd ratha attack Big
Now ya bout to smell the aftermath of what the mack did
Wannabe suckers wanna test, I'm tellin you, yes
The teflon's bout to rip through your fuckin vest
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quick
Makaveli in this, Killuminati, all through your body
The blow's like a twelve gauge shotty (Uhh, feel me!)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
to lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me, eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggaz coming for me, and my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention, rest in peace father
I'm a ghost in these killing fields
Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go
Deep inside the solitary mind of a madman who screams
In the dark evil lurks, enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupted, fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggaz is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust
It's just as well Hail Mary
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers, never realize
The precious time the bitch niggaz is wastin', institutionalized
I lived my life a product, made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we ballin'
Catch me Father please, 'cause I'm fallin', in the liquor store
That's the Hennessey I hear ya callin', can I get some more
Hail 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nothing to lose, just me and you
On a one way trip to prison, selling drugs
We all wrapped up in this living, life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max, doing they bid
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
They got a APB, out on my Thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets, like these skanless freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K blasted off of Hennessey and Thai
Chronic, mixed it, now I'm twisted, blisted, and high
Visions of me thug livin' getting me by
Forever live, and I multiply survived by Thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they coming with slugs
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers
On the regular mashing in a stolen black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw that's when I'm dead in ya
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a Thug to preaching church, I gave you love now you eating dirt
Needing work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
'Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle till dawn
That's when sun came up, it's only one way up
Hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggaz get ya pay and weight up
If it's on then it's on, we rate beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we rate beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
(Repeats in background)
We've been traveling on this weary road
Long time 'til I be take off this load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
We won't worry everything will come real
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry everything will come real
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
Come with me, Hail Mary
Nigga run quick see, what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die
La la-la la la, la la la
Westside, Outlawz, Makaveli the Don, Solo, Killuminati, The 7 Days







(2Pac)	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Oooohhh, oooohhh
(2Pac)	Nuttin to lose..
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Oahhhh, oahhhahh
(2Pac)	I got nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Oh-hahhh
(2Pac)	Stuck in the game
	Me against the world baby
Verse One: 2Pac
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin
There ain't no stoppin me
Constantly movin while makin millions
Witnessin killings, leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children cause they're illin
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin, but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetary
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live?  No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Me against the world
(2Pac)	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Ooooh yeah, ooo-hooo
(2Pac)	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Me against the world
(2Pac)	Cause it's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Hey!!
(2Pac)	Me against the world
(girl)	Ooooh yeah
(2Pac)	I got nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	I got nothing to lose
Verse Two: Dramacydal
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stones, Baby Capone's, livin wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
and screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall
Everday there's mo'death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
when I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well
(girl)	Me against the world
(2Pac)	With nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Ooh yeah.. oooh-ooooh
(2Pac)	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Me against the world
(2Pac)	I got nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Oahhhohh
(2Pac)	Ha ha
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Ha-ahh, HA-AHH!
(2Pac)	With nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Me against the world, hoahhh
(2Pac)	Me against the world
	I got nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Ha-hahh (hehe) heyy!
Verse Three: 2Pac
With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest?  Through this supression
they punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches, in a position of makin a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world
(girl)	Me against the world
(2Pac)	Nuttin to lose
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Me against the world
(2Pac)	Got me stuck in the game
	It's just me against the world
(girl)	Oahahhhh
(2Pac)	I'd be ashamed to lose
	It's just me against the world baby
(girl)	Me against the world
Outro: 2Pac
Heh, hahahahahahah
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uhh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it
(girl)	Me against the world
Me against the world 
Me against the world







How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it, yeah? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
We're livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm 'bout to pass out
Wanna dig you and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how U want it
How do U want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do U want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk, am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic
'Cause I'm some what psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' till the show is over, 'cause I'mma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these
I shall not fear no man, but God
Though I walk through tha valley of death
I shed so many tears
Please God walk with me...
Back in Elementry, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
Inside mind couldn't find a place ta rest
Untill I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
(What y'all want?)
Unconditional Love (no doubt)
Talking bout the stuff that don't wear off
It don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days
These crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
I'm guna still love you
Still feel you
Still there for you
No matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart
With unconditional love
Verse One:
Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God, so we must ask forgiveness
Ask mama why God deserved to die
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama don't cry, long as we try, maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don't need no welfare shit with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it the fighting and the hurting
In my room crying cause I didn't want to be a burden
Watch mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried bout a damn thang, with unconditional love
Chorus: 2x
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
Verse Two:
Just got the message you've been calling all week
Been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's on G
We could never be enemies, cause you been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard cause it ain't easy being who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission
Is to be more than just a rap musician 
The elevation of today's generation if could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to play and strategize, my family's gotta eat
When we make somethin out of nothing no pleasure in the suffering
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the busting
The liquor and the weed the cussing sending love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)
Chorus: 2x
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
Verse Three:
I'll probably never understand ya ways 
With everyday I swear I hear ya
Trying to change your ways while gettin paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes 
Something inside, please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe it's the way the played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes
So many vivid pictures, and all the currency I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatter us 
Cause after all the lights and screams nothing but my dreams matter
Hoping for better days maybe a peaceful night
Baby don't cry cause everythang gonna be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry bout a thang baby girl I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that, unconditional love
Chorus 3x until fade
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love







You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do to me
Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
Niggas commin' out worse off than when they went in
Over tha years I done alot of growin' up
Getten drunk thrown' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho
And when I gettem
I'll hittem with tha bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
They got me trapped....
Chorus
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
Can barely walk tha city streets
Without a cop harrassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
Bang bang, down another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
Who do you blame?
It's a shame because tha mans slain
He got caught in tha chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day i'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Chorus:
How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz?
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
It'd be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas, we tha last ones left
but life goes on.....
How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz?
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
It'd be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death
My niggas, we tha last ones left
but life goes on.....
Verse One:
As I bail through tha empty halls
breath stinkin' in my draws
ring, ring, ring
quiet y'all
incoming call
plus this my homie from high school
he's getting bye
It's time to bury another brotha nobody cry
life as a baller
alchol and booty calls
we usta do them as adolecents
do you recall?
raised as G's
loc'ed out and blazed the weed
get on tha roof
let's get smoked out
and blaze with me
2 in tha morning
and we still high assed out
screamin' 'thug till I die'
before I passed out
but now that your gone
I'm in the zone
thinkin'
'I don't wanna die all alone'
but now ya gone
and all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death
i'm drinkin' Hennessy
while tryin' ta make it last
I drank a 5th for that ass
when you passed....
cause life goes on
Chorus
Verse Two:
Yeah nigga
I got tha word as hell
blew trial and tha judge gave you
25 with an L
time to prepare to do fed time
won't see parole
imagine life as a convict
that's getten' old
plus with tha drama
we're lookin out for your babies mama
taken risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from beatin on her...
life in tha hood...
is all good for nobody
remember gamin' on dumb hotties at your party
Me and you
No true a two
while scheming on hits
and gettin tricks
that maybe we can slide into
but now you burried
rest nigga
cause I ain't worried
eyes blurry
sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
tho' memories fade
I got your name tated on my arm
so we both ball 'til my dying days
before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace
Thug till I die
Chorus
Verse Three:
Bury me smilin'
with G's in my pocket
have a party at my funeral
let every rapper rock it
let tha hoes that I usta know
from way before
kiss me from my head to my toe
give me a paper and a pen
so I can write about my life of sin
a couple bottles of Gin
in case I don't get in
tell all my people i'm a Ridah
nobody cries when we die
we outlaws
let me ride
until I get free
I live my life in tha fast lane
got police chasen' me
to my niggas from old blocks 
from old crews
niggas that guided me through 
back in tha old school
pour out some liquor
have a toast for tha homies
see we both gotta die
but ya chose to go before me
and brothas miss ya while your gone
you left your nigga on his own
how long we mourn
life goes on...
(Chorus repeats to end)
(Spoken over repeating chorus:)
Life goes on homie
gone on, cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel ya nigga, trust me
I feel ya
You know what I mean
last year
we poured out liquor for ya
this year nigga, life goes on
we're gonna clock now
get money
evade bitches
evade tricks
give players plenty space
and basically just represent for you baby
next time you see your niggas
your gonna be on top nigga
their gonna be like,
'Goddamn, them niggas came up'
that's right baby
life goes on....
and we up out this bitch
hey Kato, Mental
y'all niggas make sure it's popin' when we get up there

Got me a dog and named her Mobb bitch nigga eata

Outlaw OUTLAW 
Murder murder my mind states shit ain't change since my last rhyme 
The crime rate ain't declined 
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost their mind 
Like twenty-five to life never crossed their mind 
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang 
Dead at thirteen cause he yearn to bang 
Sniffed a lot of flowers, but how can I cry 
Try to warn the little nigga either stop or die 
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream 
Afraid to sleep I'm havin' crazy dreams 
Vivid' pictures of my enemies, family times 
God forgive me cause it's wrong but I plan to die 
Need to take me in heaven and understand I was a G 
Did the best I could, raised in insanity 
Or send me to hell cause I ain't beggin' for my life 
Ain't nothing worse than this cursed ass hopeless life 
I'm troublesome 
In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me 
I'm troublesome I don't give a fuck 
im troublesome 
like my nigga Napolean said nigga 
somebody gotta explain why I aint got shit 
im troublesome 
you know what time it is 
the Outlaw click, young rugged and sick

Brenda's (Brenda)
Got a (Got a)
Baby
(Say it one more time, baby)
Brenda's
Got a (Baby)
Baby
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family)
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now, Brenda really never knew her moms, and her dad 
Was a junky, went in debt into his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggaz to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, nahmean?
Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin up shit out there, kickin up dust
(Danny Boy) I ain't...
Givin a motherfuck, heheheheheh
Yeah, niggaz
(Danny Boy) ...mad at cha
Cause I ain't mad at cha
Verse One: 2Pac
Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still roll
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the tip, sayin how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin, I hope your wife know
she got a playa for life, and that's no bullshitin
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd BOMB
on the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that'd
go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, cause I'm just laughin at cha
You tryin hard to maintain, then go head
cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at cha)
Chorus: Danny Boy
I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha
Verse Two: 2Pac
We used to be like distant cousins, fightin, playin dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin, knowin, that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin blitzed and I reminsce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin n grindin wasn't nothin on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we seperated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin busters on they backs
in my cell, thinkin, "Hell, I know one day I'll be back"
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin at cha
Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha
Chorus: Danny Boy
I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha (2Pac: A true down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha)
Verse Three: 2Pac
Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin now
Bitches be callin to get it, hookers keep fallin down
He went from nuttin to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the Luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin so high off that bomb hopin we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin at cha
You niggaz just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha
Chorus: Danny Boy
Iiiiiiiii,
I ain't, mad at cha (2Pac: and I ain't mad at cha)
Iiiiiiiii ain't mad (2Pac: hell nah I ain't mad at cha) at cha
I ain't, mad at cha (2Pac: and I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad at cha (2Pac: I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad at cha, noooo
I ain't mad at chaaaaahhhhhhhhmm







Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
Stronger than ever
(Tupac)
Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around
What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know
(Shock G)
Now you can tell from my everday fits, I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around
(Money B)
What's up love, how you doing? (All right)
Well I've been hanging sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging
Your home girl you went to school with, that's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know, that I get around
(Tupac)
2Pacalypse now don't stop for hoes, I get around
Why I ain't call you? Ha ha, please
Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down?
I get around
(Shock G)
Round and round, round we go (Repeat 8x)







Come on come on
I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers
Give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what 
 said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah
I see no changes all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
'Cause both black and white is smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
I made a G today, But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids. I gotta get paid,
Well hey, that's the way it is
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah
We gotta make a change...
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other.
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to survive.
And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up,
Crack you up and pimp smack you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
That's the way it is, uhh
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah
You're my brother, you're my sister
That's just the way it is (way it is, way it is)
Things will never be the same
You're my brother, you're my sister
That's the way it is
Aww yeah
Some things will never change







California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A.
In the city of good old Watts
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rocking
We keep it rocking
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb-ass hemp beat
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean, mean, money-making machines serving fiends
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-I-A
California 
 knows how to party 
California 
 knows how to party 
In the city of LA 
In the city of good old Watts 
In the city, city of Compton 
We keep it rocking 
We keep it rocking
My niggas say, come on
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali 
Shake it, shake it, baby 
Shake it, shake it, baby, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene I'm hearing hoochies screamin'
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player, where cowards die
And it's all war
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally to live and die
In LA we wearing Chucks, not Ballies 
Dressed in locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossing but have caution; we collide with other crews
Famous 'cause we program worldwide
Let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know The Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sac-Town
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love
California 
 knows how to party
Really knows how to
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A. 
In the city of good old Watts 
In the city, city of Compton
We keep it rocking
We keep it rocking
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali 
Shake it, shake it, baby 
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, mama 
Shake it Cali

'Frisco, 'Frisco
Hey, you know L.A. up in this

Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento, where you at? Yeah
Throw it up, y'all, throw it up, throw it up, I can't see you








(Pac)
Clear enough for ya?
Why you niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Cold bustas!
Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling!
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federals wanna see me dead - niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands is swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'
Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Pictue me rollin
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?
(Syke)
I got ki's coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug breded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start bang banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin!
(CPO)
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some balding-ass niggas and they slipping in my spot
And, uh, diggin the plots (so what?)
Checking in the park, 'Pac
(Pac)
We caught em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflicting getting street sales!
(CPO)
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm as cool as a motherfucker: I'mma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Boss Hog and this 'Pac nigga: picture us rollin
(Pac)
Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there
I just could not forget about

Number one on my list: Clinton Correctional Facilities
All you bitch ass C.O.'s
Can you niggas see me from there?
Ballin on y'all punk ass!
Picture me rollin, baby

2Pac in this muthafucka

Tears in everybody's eyes 
Niggas cried to mourn a homies homicide

Damn, why they take another soldier

Retaliate and pull a 187 
(Tupac)
The money behind the dreams

And who he comin through right now, Makaveli the Don
Feel this, Killuminati
(Toss it up!)
Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supllied yo' phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversatin, we relaxin, kickin back
Got you curious for Thug Passion, now picture that
Tongue kissin, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you movin in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweatin up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespectin when I tongue kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, gettin busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your, hips and glide
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got ya lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shakin back-breakin when we're tossin it up
(K-Ci, JoJo)
In this baby, I like the way it's goin down
When all that is around, slip slide ride
Givin me love nice like
Female I like, what I wanna give all night
You and me alone everybody's gone toss it up
Baby let's, get it on!
I like the way you please me, babe
The sexy way you tease me, sugar

Your body hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting
So baby come on home with me, I like the way you give it to me!
Chorus: K-Ci, JoJo
I like the way you give it to me -- let me see you toss it up

(repeat 4X w/ variations)
(K-Ci, JoJo)
Ohhh, it's K-Ci baby, mmm that want you lady

Now the man, I'm here again
Don't want it to ever end

Gimme some more, oh lady lady

Bag it up yo, let me in there
Toss it up for me!!
Chorus 1/2
(Tupac)
Do you want me what's your phone number, I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searchin for paydays
No longer Dre Day, arrivederci
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plottin Child's Play
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alize
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gon' run to?
Lookin for suckers 'cause you similar
Pretendin to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screamin Compton, but you can't return, you ain't heard
Brothers pissed 'cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era, 'cause we Untouchable
Still can't believe that you got 'Pac rushin you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust, only time reveals -- toss it up!
Chorus w/ variations
(Tupac)
Play on playa, play on
How can some non-players do a song about Compton
and then wanna do a player song?
How can non-players do it? (We not little kids, we not playin)
Tellin lies, who?
Puffy, I read your little interview buddy, c'mon
You still ain't touchin us, all that peace talk
I don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street boy
It's on
Toss it up, we took you on, and we took y'all beat
You know we beat you down, and we took y'all beat
'Cause you wasn't rockin it right
Tired of suckers rockin it, toss it up, is how we did it
Yeah, toss it up now!







You are appreciated.
When I was young me and my mama had beef
17 years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys, breakin' all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary
One day, runnin' from the police that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend mama 
You always was a black queen mama 
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed, a poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it, there's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand.
You are appreciated.
Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya.
Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin' 
I needed money of my own so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone because you cared for me
And I can see you comin' home after work, late
Your in the kitchen tryin' to fix us a hot plate
Just workin' with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, your alone
Tryin' to raise 2 bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand.
You are appreciated.
Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (And dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya.
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I got to thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand.
You are appreciated.
Lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya. (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't ya know we love ya. (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady. Lady. Lady. Lady.

(Down) Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin though, hah! Yeauhh
(2Pac)
You probably crooked as the last trick; want it light
But how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin with the wrong one, uh!
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin for some love
In every club, I see you starin like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin
Guess it's true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit
Fantansies of us sweatin, can I hit it? (Hahaha)
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin Boo, is this is all about you
(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(Yeah nigga, ha ha ha ha!)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(2Pac)
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out
With the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggaz
Cause we comin from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep though, weed smoke's into the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin through..
It's all about you.. hahaha, yeah nigga!
It's all about you!
(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(Outlawz)
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe
You think it's all about you? Well Boo
I gets Down like Dru and my nasty new niggaz, too
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me
Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
(Nate Dogg)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(Snoop Doggy Dogg *speaking over last two lines*)
I'm tellin ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean.. god damn, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'm sittin back, watchin Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch, who was in, my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin out my homeboy Tupac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, yaknahmsayin?
And then yaknahmsayin what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in, the homeboy Warren G video!
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same hoe
Don't get mad, I'm only bein real
Yeah







(Dominique) Street Science, you're on the air *static*
What do you feel when you hear a record like Tupac's new one? *static*
(Man Responds) I love Tupac's new record *static*
(Dominique)
Right, but don't you feel like that creates *static*
a tension between East and West? *static*
He's talking about killing people *static*
I had sex with your wife and not in those words *static*
but he's talking about I wanna see you deceased *static*
Intro: Makaveli
No doubt... to live and die in LA
California -- what you say about Los Angeles
Still the only place for me that never rains in the sun
and everybody got love
Verse One: Makaveli
To live and die in LA, where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggaz hustle for the cash so it's hard to knok it
Everybody got they own thang, currency chasin
Worldwide through the hard times, worryin faces
Shed tears as we bury niggaz close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark, cold hearted bout it
Nigga got smoked by a fiend, tryin to floss on him
Blind to a broken man's dream, a hard lesson
Court cases keep me guessin, plea bargain
ain't an option now, so I'm stressin, cost me more
to be free than a life in the pen
Makin money off of cuss words, writin again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down Sunset likin this sin
What's the worst they could do to a nigga got me lost in hell
To live and die in LA on bail, my angel sing
Chorus: Val Young
To live and die in LA, it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
what everybody wanna see
(2X)
Verse Two: Makaveli
It's the, City of Angels and constant danger
South Central LA, can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watchin the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggaz gettin three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear the pen the right across from hell, I can't cry
'Cause it's on now, I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin life Thug style, so I can't smile
Writin to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin Cali just fun and bitches, hahaha
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggaz copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love woman
'Cause every nigga in LA got a little bit of Thug in him
We might fight with each other, but I promise you this
We'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in LA
(Let my angel sing)
Chorus
Verse Three: Makaveli
'Cause would it be LA without Mexicans?
Black love brown pride in the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin to see us all broke, I'm on some bullshit
Out for everything they owe, remember K-DAY
Weekends, Crenshaw -- MLK
Automatics rang free, niggaz lost they way
Gang signs being showed, nigga love your hood
But reconize and it's all good, where the weed at?
Niggaz gettin shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this muhfucka burned out, M.O.B.
Big Suge in the Low-Low, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex, wit a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggaz with me, OFTB
They got some hash took the stash left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Head Ron, Punchy too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin it pay
Gettin high watchin time fly, to live and die in LA
(Let my angel sing)
Chorus
Outro: Makaveli
This go out for 92.3, and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin my shit
Makin my shit sells katruple quatraple platinum, hehe
This go out to all the magazines that supported me
All the real motherfuckers
All the stores, the mom and pop spots
A&R people, all y'all motherfuckers
LA, California Love part motherfuckin Two
Without gay ass Dre







Ahh, Suge what I tell you nigga,
when I come out of jail what was I gonna do
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas chest, right
Watch this, hey Quik let me see them binoculars, nigga
The binoculars
Ha ha ha ha, yeah nigga time to ride
Grab your bulletproof vest nigga 
cause its gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik gonna show you niggas what it's like on this side
The real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real mutha-fuckas 
and there's gonna be some pussys
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussys are gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize cause the ride get tricky
See you got some niggas on your side
That say they're your friends 
But in real life they your enemies
And then you got some mutha-fuckas that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See the enemies will say they true
But in real life those niggas will be the snitches
Its a dirty game y'all
Y'all got ta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with
Cause the shit get wild y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, Baby
Keep your mind on your riches
9-1-1 its a emergency cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar
cowards die
My mama told me When I was to see
Just a vicious mutha fucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver 
when I deliver
Criminal lyrics 
from a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Mackaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, thats what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinitely Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches 
like a south paw you get let
And every breath I breathe untill the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Internally I live in sin 
untill the moment that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men
(Chorus)
The Heartz of Men
My lyrical verse with so much pain 
that to some niggas it hurts 
My guns bust
And if you ain't one of us 
it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll 
in fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw 
and five-o, get your lights on, fight long 
tonights gonna be a fuckin' fight 
so we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a 'G' to this 'til the day I'm gone that's regardless
Drive-by, niggas bow down
thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up 
first nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villian if ya let me 
I'll Muthafuck ya 
if ya do upset me 
tell the cops to come and get me
rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no muthafuckin' friends nigga
Look inside the heartz of men
(Chorus)
In The Heartz of Men
In The Heartz of Men
To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear 
my pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year 
like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a Don
If niggas is having problems 
smoke'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back, 
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing 
scar'd up 
but still flowing
energized and still going
Uhh, can it be fate 
that makes a sick muthafucka break
On these jealous ass coward cuz they evil and fake




(Reporter)
Good Evening (sirens in the background)
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles
(crowd starts chanting "Tupac")
Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac
Which, raises the question
Where are these songs coming from?
It's interesting how, the message in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now
(Crowd)
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...

















Troublesome nigga
Troublesome 19-motherfucking-96
Westside
Let it be known nigga
the boss of all bosses
Makaveli
hahaha
Menacing Methods, Label me a lethal weapon
Making niggas die, witnessin' breathless imperfection
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore 
I was all about my ends fuck friends and foes 
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her mob bitch nigga eater
What could they do to me ya little brat
Shit them niggas done shot me and still terrified i'll cut they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside
We outlawz, motherfuckas can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit but that's after I'm gone
Cause they fear me in the physical form 
Let it be known I'm troublesome
Troublesome nigga
Outlawz
We put it down to the fullest
Spitting rhymes and bullets
Haha...
Troublesome
Ya'll know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets Haha..
Troublesome
Yeah
Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet i bomb on them first 
Niggas knew we came for murda, pullin' up in a herse
Westside was the war cry bustin' all freely 
Screaming fuck all ya niggas in Swaheli
Pistol packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless trap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on your ass like an avalanche
A soul survivor, learned to get high and pull driveby's
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta ass motherfuckas tried to flee
Picture me lettin this chump survive
Ran up on his ass when I dump he died
Cause I'm troublesome
Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck
I'm hopelesssss
I live a thuglife, losing my focus baby
I'm troublesome
haha...
Badboy Killa
There is no one realler
What you saw was the rough, rugged and raw
Outlaw OUTLAW
Murder murder my mindstate shit ain't change since my last rhyme
The crime rate ain't declined
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost their mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed their mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen cause he yearn to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how can I cry
Try to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep im havin' crazy dreams
Vivid' pictures of my enemies and family times
God forgive me cause its wrong but I plan to die
You can take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothing worse than this cursed ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome
In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
I'm troublesome I don't give a fuck
im troublesome
like my nigga napolean said nigga 
somebody gotta explain why i aint got shit
im troublesome
you know what time it is
the outlaw click, young rugged and sick
makaveli the don, the boss of all bosses
Mussolini, Idi Amin, Hussein Fatal, Khadafi, 
Kastro, Napoleon, Mo Khomani
We aint fucking around
We troublesome
hey yo
We troublesome
Young Kastro, the first to blast the last one to dash
He going for the hoes and the cash

Khadafi trump tight never sloppy
them other fuckers try to copy

outlaw keep it going on
you know wassup
outlaws outlaws

all the real troublesome soldiers on the streets

[2Pac - over background voices]
My ghetto love song, hahaha, let's be friends..
(Where my niggaz at? Where my niggaz where my bitches?
 Where my niggaz at? Where my bitches at?
 Throw your hands in the air
 Everybody just throw your hands in the air) 
Let's be friends..
(Wessyde in this motherfucker right here, Wessyde..)
[2Pac]
Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted
As you pass bye wink in my eye, freshly scented
What's the haps baby? Come get with me and perhaps lady
you can help me multiply my stacks baby
Currency seems small I need companionship (hey)
Through with that - scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitating actin like yo' shit don't stink
Check out my - diamonds bitch everyone gonna blink
This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreaming motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my resume, sipping on Cristal and Alize
Smoking on big weed, keyed the Cali way
Don't like tricking but I'll buy you a fifth
I can't stand no sneaker-wearing nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree, re-breed me, they're so cheap
Putting bitch-made busters to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so-called comp, who the man?
While I'm tugging on yo' main bitch head
Understand this, ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay-Z
He broke and I smoke daily baby let's be friends
[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]
Let's be friends (where my niggaz at? come on)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
friends.. (all my niggaz, where my hoes at?)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (where the bitches at, where the niggaz with money?)
(where you at baby?)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
friends.. (cash makin hoes)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
[2pac]
I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass, it was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass got me checkin for you hardcore; staring and watching
Me and you one on one (see that bitch) picture countless options
Was it prophecy?  Clear as day, visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, we possess bubonics
Far from a crush I wanna bust your guts and touch
everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweating like a fat girl goin for mine
Just a skinny nigga fucking like she stole my mind
Back in time I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in 9-6?  Fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre, tell that bitch he can kiss my ass
Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs now, let me in between as friends
[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]
Let's be friends (wessyde, motherfucker right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
friends.. (wessyde in this motherfucker)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (wessyde in this motherfucker right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
friends.. (in this motherfucker right here)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
[2Pac]
Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks
I got em ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch
Was it me or the fame?  My dick or the game?
Bet I scream WESTSIDE when I came
Scream my name, cause baby it's delicious got a weak spot
for pretty bitches up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby let your back get into it
Make it fluid, in and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high!  Let me come inside!
I love it when you get on top, baby let me ride!
Who wanna stop me?  Am I top notch?
Fuck player hating niggaz cause they cock block
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a living out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good - in this world of G's
Baby got me fantasizing, seeing you naked
It's the fuck song, so check my record
And let's be friends
(Where my niggaz at?  Show me where my niggaz at?
 Where my bitches at)  Thug style!
[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]
Let's be friends (where my niggaz at, where my bitches at?)
(Throw yo' guns in the air!)
Friends.. (my ghetto love song, it goes on and on and on and on)
Let's be friends (where my niggaz at, where my bitches at?)
(Where my niggaz at?)
Friends.. (where my niggaz at, where my bitches at?)
(Where my people at?  Let's be..)
[2Pac]
Where my people at?  Show me where my people at
Where my people at?  Show me where my people at
All my niggaz now, just my niggaz come
Where my niggaz at?  Just my niggaz now
Be friends, tell me where my niggaz at
Be friends, tell me where my bitches at
Be friends, tell me where my people at
Be friends, tell me where my bitches at
Make money, take money, be friends
[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]
Let's be friends (get your cash on, let's, get dough)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
friends.. (c'mon, get your cash on)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (c'mon, get your cash on, let's, get paid)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
friends.. (c'mon, getcha cash on)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
Make money, take money! (*repeat 5X*)







Lets turn this house into a happy home
This is for all the homeboys that couldn't get their happy home
Lets turn this house into a happy home
As long one of us got it some of us got it
Lets turn this house into a happy home
You know how that is, stay down for me boo
Hold on
(Verse 1)
Now we been kicking it for quite some time
Remain beside me through these trials and this life of crime
We done fought so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight
Sippin alize and crystal while in every night
In my bedroom, promise that I'll commit to you sometime
Kiss me every time you see me step inside a room
Promise to be good to each other
Plus I love ya so I know your gonna make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change in time
It's only cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm trying
You can stay with my mama but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch or hoe
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house
And got a happy home
(Chorus)
Happy Home
Lets turn the house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally made it outta moms house, and got a happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Heh
(Verse 2)
Going through these hard times
Ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your fathers crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God knowing you'll get scarred though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's mama made her my wife now
I'm trying hard y'all
Maybe in time, I'll be a better man
Watchin the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of together and forever we rise
If it would help our child grow then together we die
Why, question my love? It's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life
Inside this happy home
(Chorus)
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally got to live the good life, inside this happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Happy Home
(Tupac talking)
All these problems got me gone
We got a family of our own
I just want a happy home
Turn this house into a happy home
No man's made to stand alone
I promise I won't do you wrong
I just want a happy home
Finally made it outta moms house, and got a happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Finally got to live the good life, inside this happy home
Happy Home
Turn this house into a happy home
Happy Home
Hey
Turn this house into a happy home
As long one of us got it some of us got it
Turn this house into a happy home







[LT Hutton talking]
Uh oh, Uh oh, Oh!, Oh!, Oh! 
They ain't ready for this 
LT Hutton 
T.I. 
Ashanti 
It's that new 'Pac y'all 
[Chorus: Ashanti]
Pac's life 
(Everybody need's to chill) 
Everybody talking 'bout Pac's life 
(It's Tupac the king) 
What do you know about Pac's life 
(What do you know? What do you know?) 
(Only real niggas stay on top) 
Everybody talking 'bout Pac's life 
(Outlawz) 
[Verse One: Tupac]
Started with five shots, niggas plotting to kill him 
Never figured that, that same nigga sell five million 
Hit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits 
Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits 
Dodging cop cars look how we come so far 
Picture a high school drop out 
Rolling a double R 
House full of happiness, weed and drank 
Way out 
So when trouble tried to find me can't 
Never visioned living longer than my twenty first 
Thought I'd locked down, cracked out or in the dirt 
And though it hurts to see the change 
It comes with the fame 
Watch them gossip in this silly game 
To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night 
Why's everybody caught up In Pac's life? 
To all y'all niggas 
Conversating on my life 
Mind your motherfucking business 
[Chorus]
[Verse Two: T.I]
I remember that 
Ay 
What's happening Pac 
Yeah I know we never got to meet 
But we know all the same people so we got to speak 
You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G 
And all the shit you went through 
Meant a lot to me 
But when they locked you up for for nothing it was shame to see 
You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me 
I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be 
Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me 
And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see 
Now they all in the court room blaming me 
See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle 
Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's 
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em 
Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's 
Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's 
With the same sort of dude with he same short fuse 
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Tupac]
I want money in large amounts 
My garage full of cars that bounce 
Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts 
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks 
They running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump 
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary 
While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass 
Nigga you scary 
I been knowing you for years 
We was high school peers 
In Junior High 
I was itching' to kill 
And you was, 'Ready To Die' 
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases 
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places 
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried 
Bitches die in a hurry 
Still I ride, I'm never worried 
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride 
Pick my enemies out the crowd 
And motherfucker's die 
It's not the way I wanna live 
My nigga it's how it is 
Only real niggas stay on top 
[Chorus]
Why are all you niggas all up in my shit? 
Tell them motherfucker's 
Outlawz 
Fuck all y'all













Uhh.. dear Mr. President
Whas happenin?
I'm writin you because, shit is still real fucked up in my neighbourhood
Pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
Ain't nothin changed
All the promises you made, before you got elected..
.. they ain't came true
(2Pac)
Tell me what to do, these niggaz actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President
(Me and my homies is wonderin what's goin on.. holla!)
Tell me what to do, these niggaz actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops..
Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
Niggaz fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
cause I'm seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, nigga what you smokin on?
Figure if we high they can train us
but then America fucked up and blamed us
I guess it's cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
I ride for Mutulu like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
(What should I do?)
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
(E.D.I. Amin)
Oh youse a ball in the White House, I hope you comfortable
cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
and young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
Launch it, leave a nigga flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Wanna ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin pay the day besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same nigga
Trippin to drastic measures tryin to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'fuckers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin better
But you keep, tellin us, that it is
while your motherfuckin troops keep killin our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherfucker
Dear Mr. President, tell us what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
(Kastro)
Strapped and angry, with no hope and heartbroke
Fightin first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggaz lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
to people beefin and things, squeakin on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
for a struggle out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223's will freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
and I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President
Shit is still fucked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
and it ain't gon' get better
(2Pac)
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up..
Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
He's scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug Nigga
We tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin in my own blood
Lookin for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President
(Big Syke)
Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin low?
Y'all sniffin blow and postin what they hittin fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin
Til then we gonna keep it comin, Mr. President
Hehe
And I meant every word in my letter to the President
(2Pac)
Word motherfuckin life
Fuck this nigga think?
Cuttin taxes, takin off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin?
Motherfuckers crazier than a motherfuckin scout
Nigga this Thug Life, Westside Outlaw Immortalz nigga
We fin' to hustle til we come up
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. Clinton, shit
It's gettin harder and harder for a motherfucker
to make a dollar in these here streets
I mean shit, I hear you screamin peace
But we can't find peace
till my little niggaz on these streets get a piece
I know you feel me cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a nigga out?
Sayin you cuttin welfare
That got us niggaz on the street, thinkin who in the hell care?
Shit, y'all want us to put down our glocks and our rocks
but y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid
Think you got us lookin to lose
Tryin to turn all us young niggaz into troops
You want us to fight your war
What the fuck I'm fightin for?
Shit, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year
Taxin, all the blacks and
police beatin me in the streets
Fuck peace
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops







(Big Syke)
Ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown.....  
(2Pac)Fucking with this Alazay, my Nigger Johny Jackson - studio fellows motherfuckers. He he, alright!
(2Pac)
Somebody wake me I'm dreaming, I started as a seed the semen
Swimming upstream, planted in the womb while screaming
on the top, was my pops, my momma screaming stop
From my single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plans for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, a product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive?  Got me asking white Jesus
will a nigga live or die, cause the Lord can't see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleeping
I open my window jump to the streets and get to creeping
I can live or die, hope I get some money before I'm gone
I'm only nineteen, I'm trying to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops trying to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks glocks or a heroin bong
You can ask my man he's a mind reader
Keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out, pass the weed nigga
That Hennessy ya'll keep me keyed nigga
Everywhere I go niggers holla at me, Keep it real G
And my reply til they kill me
Act up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise.
(Big Syke)
Ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown.....
(Kadafi)
I stay sharp as always
Running ya bricks with blitz, do your project always - don't be
cruz by tools - nigga knows all their 
Secrets so war prepared me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seems thou, be placing triple beams and things bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot popping out my jeans
(Fatal)
..................
(Khadafi)
In ninety-six my glock's my plastic, passion for blasting bastards
No faces for open caskets, peeling ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress - Leaving holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew bobby Mo-green in topic 
and loot to keep the seams in my motherfucking jeans popping
Leaving ya spleen to pick up
Half of you niggers is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker - 
and still I rize, and still I rize. and still I rize, still I rize.
(Big Syke)
Ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown, ninety-six big body see no grown.....
(Kid)
Matter what you motherfuckers do to me, I'll still come up - fuck all y'all. Y'all can't fuck with the real shit, real nigger... shit out - y'all niggers be thankful, all day every day. Now I got a r... for you. BIG, I though you knew, I'm out of the hood. Come on Pac, - I got to get the fuck out of here Pac, got some hoes waiting for you outside. (2Pac)What you said? (Kid) I said, we got some hoes waiting for you outside.







Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
(E.D.I. Amin)
War Time
War Time, it's either yourz or mine
Outlawz be on a grind, and a mission to shine
And ride on em', leave em' stuck and fucked from the gate
Set it straight, regulate wit' a bomb I'm about to detonate (Boom!)
Hesitate, aww, now you know what
ya'll niggaz were here to go
If you know it was good for ya
Buncha toy souljahs all dressed in fatigue
But I'm Edi Amin on a mission to make em bleed
Nigga what?, Nigga who?
It was cool? and at you?, what the fuck is gone do?
Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die, get money all at the same time
Split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
Any nigga splippin', fall at the same time
We all laced in the chain, tryin' to gain, do time
We all see the sunshine
But when you could do yourz, we'll bring these muthafuckas war
Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
(2Pac)
As I approach the scene, from smokin' green
Got my eyes closed, niggaz so cold on my foes
I make em' die froze
Watch me make em' bleed, make em' G's
Lord help me wit'it
Got me paintin' pictures of a mil-ticket
Help me get'it
See me and pray for options
And this pressures, nonstop
Niggaz get the pistol poppin'
And watch they body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set
Flash on, blast on them bitch-made niggaz wit' my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seein' demons hittin' weed
Got me hearin' screamin'
Scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope-fiend
Probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggaz pass the cush and watch me bring em' to the floor
I got some shit that they ain't ready for (What you got?)
I got the Secretz of War
Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
(Yaki Kadafi)
We do this thug life shit, like 4, 5, 6, dick em'
Down wit' no rounds left up in the pound when the sounds (Here we go)
Squeeze the lead off, I blow his mutha fuckin' head off
Signal all the other outlawz to get this shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain't a cop here to stop me
These streetz is black hockey and raw we get sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar
Locked in the slammer, while I'm layed cocked back like a hammer
Ya'll newly weds that in honey moons, times bout up
Ya'll, that means I leave no trace found with you face, bounce, stuck
Your pig scanners can't come close touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt, puttin' in work, you see shit, what you gonna do?
Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
Yo, we go to war
(Young Noble)
We check the murder rate percentage
Niggaz is finished
Get blood checks from clinics
This thug shit is in us
Flowin' through my system, you a victim
Blunts, I twist em', fuck the whole world
It's us against them
You got some teeth?, pull it out
Cock the hammer if you wit' it, don't make
No difference if, wit' 20 by the life sentence
We already doin' life on the streetz
Like Ali G, niggaz be heated, when they walkin' the beat
This shit is flaky, makin' backs shaky, niggaz hate me
Scared to face me, knowin' that the Outlawz blaze me
Pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I suck my money muscle, all the G's got devils
Movin' shit like a dollar, beatin' niggaz like Rodney
Turn a killa like Kadafi, and a nuke stream to stop me
Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
We go to war
(2Pac)
Bring it on
And all you lil' young ass souljahs
You play this shit back about fifteen times
You'll have enough game to roll up in a club or somethin
Teach these bitches a lil' somethin', you know what I mean?
Secretz of muthafuckin' War....







I feel you (Ah) (Baby, don't)
But you can't, you can't give up (Hey, 2Pac what?)
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up (Outlawz)
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up (Keep ya head up)
Now here's a story bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat, so when she asked me
"What would you do if it was you?"
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggaz grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain, Lord come and take me
Four niggaz violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No, you got to find a way to survive
'Cause they win when your soul dies
Baby, please don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up (Never give up)
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up (Never give up)
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry
Forget him, girl (Forget him, girl), he ain't gon' never change
I ain't no hater but that nigga lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
He probably could love you, but he in love with the struggle
Everyday, his mind on gettin mo' (Gettin mo')
And never your feelings, he's chasin millions fo' sho'
Oh, oh (Oh, oh), now you 'bout to have his baby? (Damn!)
Another wild-ass nigga that's gon' drive you crazy
You got too much, mo', livin to do I'm spittin this to you,
'Cause you deserve more than what he givin to you (That's right)
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
A new millennium dime piece, so fine she
Got em all stuck standin' still when she come through
Baby, take a little mo' time, love'll find you
And show us the sky's blue somebody other than me
Gon' give you everything you need, feel me? (Don't cry)
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up (You'll be alright)
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up (You'll be alright)
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up (Keep your head up)
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up (Never give up)
Even when the road is hard, never give up (No, no, oh)
Baby, don't cry
I'm tryin' to do all that I can, from jump
Now you losin', you was choosin' the wrong man
Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
Lost and turned out, what you let that nigga do to you? (Damn)
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin' to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homey roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her, Pampers and food, just to stop through
But those, ain't my seeds, nuttin' really I could do (Nah)
I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
Seventeen with three kids, locked down for life
Shoulda chose me, she 'bout to O.D. from the pressure
Hell, nah, I won't let her (Baby, don't cry)
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up (You'll be alright)
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up (Baby, don't cry)
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up (Baby, baby, baby)
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up (No)
Even when the road is hard, never give up (No, oh)
Baby, don't cry, I gotta keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up (Oooh, baby)
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up (Keep your head up)
(Keep your head up, never give up)
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry
Ah, ah, yeah, don't give up (You'll be alright)
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby, don't cry
For all the ladies (Soulshock, Karlin)
Baby, don't cry
Got to keep your head up (<eep your head up)
Makaveli the Don (Head up), aight?







(2Pac)
As the world turns..
As the world turns my niggaz grow and grow and grow
and get dough and roll and ride
Niggaz die and mommas cry
Niggaz got alibis and suicides and homicides
and three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And niggaz fame, as the world turns..
Though I walk thru the valley of hell the shadow follows me
Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
and still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build, and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change 
if we search deeper, god bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deeper inside
We we ride plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin them fakes smile plastic tears
like last year, niggaz stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the Mob, M-O-B
Killin bustaz is my motherfuckin job, him or me
Lyrically fatally driven, niggaz reported missin
My competition dead or in prison, as the world turns...
Chorus: Darryl 'Big D' Harper, (Tupac - in background)
(Turns.. turns, turns, turns, and turns
My niggaz grow and grow and grow
and gettin dough and dough and dough
from this state to that state
from this cell to that cell, as the world turns)
As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns.. and steady turnin
(Young Noble)
As the world turn burnin paths, starin through my rearview
It's a war goin on, and the President is in too
I hear Tu-Pac sayin, Watch em they'll kill you
Sippin Thug Passion, scrub actin like he feel you
Steady plottin, ready or not; Outlawz lost 
but not forgotten, from Gittere to Compton
A spitter of the hotness, long timeness
So like six I ain't never been rich
I need cream, to buy Ellene a dream house
She no longer fiend out y'all, Outlawww
(Napoleon)
Another lonely nigga with a 12-gage pump
with a 12-hour rush to run and get this money, fuck these punks
Road rules I swim in the dirt, I stay in some skirt
I hit where it hurts, I ride or die for my turf
I ride or die for Makaveli the legendary war thug nigga
Kadafi betta unslug this nigga, Seike betta undrug this nigga
Out of the buildin we street children with no souls
Our hearts gon' stay cold, the war gon' stay on
We serve em, like Pac told us to, catch em wet with the tec
Hit em in the neck and watch him die like he supposed to
Napoleon the front line soldier, front times over
Rider for the mightly dollar rather drunk or sober
Nigga talkin thug walkin all through yo' squad
Y'all niggaz scared by a dog, I got my fo'-fo' for y'all
It's like a hot, heated day homie, warfare don't play homie
Better be prepared than try to dunk away from these strays homie
Worlds turn, thangs burn, all in one shot
Rest in peace to the fallen soldiers, all that we got
As the world turns..
Chorus: Darryl 'Big D' Harper, (Tupac - in background)
(And my niggaz roll and ride, hahaha
Niggaz gettin swoll out
And it don't stop and it don't quit
That real shit! As the world turns..
Niggaz die for
How many you niggaz try for this? As the world turns
Murderin methods.. haha OUTLAW!)
As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns.. and steady turnin
As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns..
(E.D.I. Amin)
Only haters caught feelings, when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us
Fellas - mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin armies ridin soldiers, gone wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nuttin left to earn
(Kadafi)
October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my Mack-11 hit the block playin
Only five years up in this bitch, poppa runnin from the Feds
Puttin peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown but only man of the home
to protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin straight shots of Cristal Brothers
Hundred dollar snot box on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
for this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns
Chorus: Darryl 'Big D' Harper (repeats as Tupac speaks)
(2Pac)
Hahaha.. as the world turns..
and turns and turns and turns.. haha
This for the soldiers out there involved in the everyday struggle
Hopin to bubble, keep on hustlin, as the world turns
Money come and go, hoes come and go, foes come and go
Friends come and go.. my soldiers, stay eternal
Outlaw Immortalz, dedicated
I send this to black Jesus, only he can feed us
When you need us, as the world turns
Throw this shit in the deck, hahah
Niggaz gettin chin checked
From the East to the West best to wear a vest
Nigga we ain't the ones to test, fuck you
As the world turns
Outlaw ridahs, Mutah right beside us
Camillion, wanna make a million
Haha legit, as the world turns.. haha.. 
Burn baby burn
(Napoleon)
A lot of niggaz get burned as the world turns
A lot of niggaz gettin burned as the world turns..
Gettin burned as the world turns







(2Pac)
Searching for Black Jesus
Oh yeah, sportin jewels and shit, yaknahmean?
(Black Jesus; you can be Christian
Baptist, Jehovah Witness)
Straight tatted up, no doubt, no doubt
(Islamic, won't matter to me
I'm a thug; thugs, we praise Black Jesus, all day)
Young Kadafi in this bitch, set it off nigga..
What?
(Kadafi)
I do my shootin's on a knob, prayin to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards 
like I'm jailin, shots hittin up my spot like midnight rains hailin
Got me bailin to stacks more green; Gods ain't tryin to be trapped
on no block slangin no rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin
Wonder how shit like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
Gods words all cursed like crack
Shai-tan's way of gettin us back
Or just another one of my Black Jesus traps
(Storm)
Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin up in silence
Dark prayer, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
Cause I swear, they tryin to break my will
I'm on the edge lookin down at this bottomless pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus
(2Pac)
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus, hahahahaha
He's like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
(Young Noble)
Outlawz we got our own race, culture, religion
Rebellin against the system, commence to lynchin
The President ain't even listenin to the pain of the youth
We make music for eternity, forever the truth
Political prisoner, the two choices that they givin us
Ride or die, for life they sentence us
Oh Black Jesus, please watch over my brother Shawn
Soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm
Brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
Ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
History repeats itself, nuttin new
In school I knew, e'rything I read wasn't true
Black Jesus
(2Pac)
To this click I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggaz pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggaz play together
We die clutchin glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated, last wishes nigga smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin, hopin for possibilities
I'll mob on, why they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hatin the people livin in them
I was born an inmate, waitin to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast til they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze facin Black Jesus
(2Pac)
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
(Kastro)
Some say, some day, some how, some way, we gon' fail
And it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell
Trapped, black, scarred and barred
Searching for truth, where it's hard to find God
I play the Pied Piper, and to this Thug Life, I'm a lifer
Proceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes
My Black Jesus, walk through this valley with me
Where we, so used to hard times and casualties
Indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
And haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
And all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
Blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums
This ain't livin... Jesus
(singers repeat in background 3X)
We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!
Searchin for Black Jesus
It's hard, it's hard
We need help out here
So we searchins for Black Jesus
It's like a Saint, that we pray to in the ghetto, to get us through
Somebody that understand our pain
You know maybe not too perfect, you know
Somebody that hurt like we hurt
Somebody that smoke like we smoke
Drink like we drink
That understand where we coming from
That's who we pray to
We need help y'all

Oh shit, caught that nigga alone
Ain't that a bitch
Hey, uh, this one here is, uhh
for them niggaz that be Johnny Dangerous when they be fuckin fifty deep
But they be fuckin cowards when they by theyselves
You know who I'm talkin about
(You know who I'm talkin about) that's right
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
Now
Now everytime I see you cats is rollin in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga it's a god damn shame, somebody explain 
why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin in the casket
How long will it last, nigga don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate 
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggaz aimin at my head but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck motherfuckers I'm loc
They all duckin when my gun smoke
cause you ain't shit without your homeboys
You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a fuck, you niggaz is punks
Without your homeboys, you be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary niggaz is punks, you ain't shit without your homeboys
Nigga, punk ass motherfucker
You ain't shit without your homeboys
Throw your hands up yo
