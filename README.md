# Lyrics Scraper
Python program that retrieves all lyrics from a specific artist (or list of artists) available on Lyrics Wiki. For reference: http://lyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Lyrics_Wiki

This program was created to test lyric creation by training a Recursive Neural Network. I used this convenient repo here: https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn

### How to use
First, write all the artists names whose lyrics you want to retrieve in `list.dat`. Make sure that they are valid artists names as listed on Lyrics Wiki.

After that, save your file and run (this was tested on Python 2.7):

`python scraper.py`
